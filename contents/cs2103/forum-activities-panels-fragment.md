**1. :fas-info-circle: Scope of exam (Unified process, critical path, padding)**
</div>

These "exam-like" questions appear in the course briefing and I have a few questions

1. Unified process seems to be an optional topic in the textbook so will it be tested?
2. i cant seem to find anything in the textbook related to _padding_, can someone link me to the page please
3. Critical path (PERT Chart) seems to be an optional topic in the textbook, so will a question like this be tested? unless this question is related to optimising a usecase

**2. :fas-info-circle: typo for week 9 textbook: fork exercise**

There seems to be a typo in week 9 textbook Activity Diagrams → Basic Notation → Parallel Paths → Exercise: Which sequence of actions are supported?

G1 H1 G2 should be compliant (underlined below)

I think there seems to be an error in the textbook in W5.3e Requirements → Specifying Requirements → User Stories → Usage

The chapter is about user stories and not use cases

**4. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on textbook and models**
</div>

##  Q1 Can a model be used as a blueprint for software? because in the textbook it says yes while in the lecture it says no

<img width="800" height="600" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ba6f6d2-c605-41c6-9bb6-528f6d0a5bb1" />

##  Q2 Will books and their authors be tested as part of the syllabus?
Might be a stupid question but some questions related to books and their authors are in the weekly quizzes and are in the textbook (not labelled optional)

e.g. What is the book written by Fred. Brooks (a. The Mythical Manager Month, b. The Mythical Man Month)
e.g. Who wrote that aggregation symbol should be omitted (a. Martin Fowler, b. Three Amigos)
e.g. Who wrote that SLAP is about One Level of Abstraction per Function (a. Neal Ford, b. Robert C. Martin)

## Q3 Are "resources" in the textbook tested? (as long as they are not mentioned anywhere else in the course)
As per #580 , hyperlinks are not tested but the quizzes has questions like these

<img width="800" height="600" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/027be096-2921-42d6-98cf-65ae880c94eb" />

**5. :fas-info-circle: response NotInScope clarification**
</div>

It is said that grammatical errors can be `response.NotInScope` but how do we "prove" that it is `response.NotInScope`

<img width="986" height="110" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a893de1-5d6e-44ea-97c9-470117717b65" />
<br><br><br>

On top of that, it says that any "missing features" can be `response.NotInScope` but if we need to have it specified in the UG "xxx is coming in the future version" it opens up the possibility as there are many "missing features" which will be illogical to list them out in the UG

Will the second point "if the user attempts to use the missing feature, it fails gracefully" be applicable? - say if the user wants this xyz command, but inputting the xyz command fails gracefully since it is an invalid command

Anyways, the bug reporter labeled a missing feature as severity.Medium which means any "missing features" (which there will be alot) are all severity.Medium?

would be good to wait for prof's reply but i think could be a `severity.Medium`
as it is a "flaw" in the DG that is an inconvenience to the "Reader" (other developers). considering that they did not meet the requirements for the course can be put in the TEAMMATES review

i would say it could be a `severity.medium` documentation bug as the user could be expected to type the examples given

However depending on what format/rule it violated, it could also be a `minor typo`

I think for DG bugs we can follow this labels.

<img width="711" height="268" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef973181-a05b-47a6-9e1f-41fdb499704b" />
<br><br>

as such any typos are probably `VeryLow` but any major diagram issues or issues with the explanation could be `Medium` if it is hard to understand by another developer

`High` will probably be only if the DG is missing an explanation for a command

I feel that a constraint violation is definitely a `type.FeatureFlaw` as seen here

<img width="723" height="314" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0e6ac97-6f59-4832-bdbf-7e3baa04fe5d" />

I feel that the severity level will vary based on how "buggy" the feature is, but the fact that is violates the constraint is meant to be marked down in the TEAMMATES review

The question now is to what extent it violates the feature. I think it highly depends on what the program and what the feature is but based on the constraint (the screenshot you provided)

It will violate if 
1. multiple instances of the application can be opened and used at the same time
2. a data file created by one application can be used by another during operations

> I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to reveal any information about the team I am bug testing for. I think all I can say is that it is not a major feature of the program, like it is still usable even without that command.

I think if it isn't a "major feature" then it could be a `severity.Low` since by definition `Low` means it happens in "rare situations"

<img width="707" height="331" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f503b76-8c28-4fab-9650-ca2a06dd5b0e" />

if the error occurs at the "same location" like `glossary missing x,y,z` i think it can be combined as `glossary missing important details` 

but if it occurs multiple different areas, it is better to split them

<img width="782" height="237" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbace1b8-7527-423e-b97b-cf50553654b3" />

Severity i think should be based on how many users will encounter that bug and how that bug affects the usability of the program
`Low` -&gt; rare situations, maybe like edge cases
`Medium` -&gt; high portion of users will encounter, but can use product
`High` -&gt; high portion of users will encounter, might not be able to use product

Hi just to add on, because when I read `Terminal output` I took it as the Terminal Log / the console when you run via IDE

Because if it only appears on that console IDE terminal, I wouldnt count it as a bug in any way since the end user is not expected to see such results

but if it appears in anyway in front on the GUI then it can be marked under this `FeatureFlaw`

<img width="766" height="211" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45c970c0-f337-4711-8480-3e5c3ae7431d" />

and I think if it is of a "common command" as mentioned above, could be a `severity.Medium` as seen below since it causes an inconvenience to some users and not in "rare situations"

<img width="716" height="328" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf2fb24-540b-4b53-a839-7aaeec82658a" />

Hope this helps!

in fact i find it hard to believe 100+ lines of error code is output to the GUI unless there is something seriously wrong with the code logic

I also encountered a same problem in which my program had 2 commands `filter &lt;parameter + keyword>` and `find &lt;keyword>` in which `find` just does `filter by name`.

I decided to err on the side of caution and not report this as its hard to argue for the severity and whether or not it "fits well with the product" since the programmers can say `filter by name` is a very common instruction so another command that is optimised for it (no parameter needed) is created

I think it depends on what the issue is exactly, but as per your screenshot given. It needs to be argued well that it is `independently-fixable` which means you have to look at the code closely.

could be hard to argue and maybe its best to err on the side of caution

@damithc 
Hi prof, just to add on, does integer overflow fit under `response.Rejected` or `reponse.NotInScope`?

As seen in the picture below, integer overflows can be considered as `response.Rejected` because of extreme user behaviour<br>

<img width="700" height="253" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d44f292-b1de-4ad7-840e-0c8f4b22d060" /> <br><br>

But since it is recommended to label as `response.NotInScope` rather than `reponse.Rejected` it is hard to put as `response.NotInScope` since integer overflow errors were not specified in the UG and do not fail gracefully

I would believe that this will be `response.Rejected` because the user did not follow the start-up instructions.

Not only that, if you had something like this in your User Guide (picture below), the user should not be doing "invalid" edits to the data file

<img width="700" height="412" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47611c38-9369-4970-8c96-a0614e333aa2" />

i think having 2 arrows vs having one line with bidirectional is different dependent on context

if person has a cat + cat has a breeder but the person is not necessarily the breeder then it is the 2 arrows
- in object diagram it will look like this owner:Person -&gt; :Cat -&gt; breeder:Person

but if the person is always the breeder (maybe in the example person has a cat and cat has a owner) then it is a bidirectional arrow 
- in object diagram it will look like this owner:Person &lt;-> :Cat

**3. :fas-info-circle: Proposed improvement is notInScope, but if implemented it will break documentation, reject?**
</div>



tl;dr technically `notInScope` but if implemented, strays from expected and **currently** documented behaviour

As stated in the title, one of the issues raised in my team's PE is a notInScope:
We have a fuzzy search feature that returns the top 5 closest results.
However, this returned list is not ordered according to the "close-ness" to the query string, but ordered in the current comparator for our `sortedList` aka `sort` feature.
Note that our sorting is persistent, be it after `list` or `find`

The DG and UG does explicitly state that the results are unordered.
So I feel that it is suitable for `notInScope`. 

However, assuming that we did implement this and maybe also state in DG/UG that for our fuzzy search it is sorted according to  the "closeness" of the query technically it can be claimed that it is a feature-flaw because it violate's sort's expected behaviour.

I would like to ask the teaching team if this is possible, as a means to show the team that certain authors are trying to "game" the system.

As an example, my team got an issue where the author claimed that even though the usage message stated the value of our `tag` is alphanumerical only, the app does not allow spaces for `tag`

The problem is that any quick google search will tell you that alphanumericals do not contain spaces.

Although this was quick and easy to reject, it is extremely frustrating as developers to see these issues getting raised.

Due to how my group is also considering team tasks as "workload" i.e. some can be given to persons with less code workload, would I get marked down if I only did a little bit of team tasks?

There does not seem to be enough to equally distribute because most of the "larger" tasks are easier to be done by a single person (e.g. github repo setup, gradle setup) etc. And most of them are done already

**14. :fas-info-circle: JUnit testing for boolean checks (instead of exceptions) --> Too Trivial?**
</div>

Basically, how my parser works is that (roughly)
Instead of doing something like `getArgument` and then throwing an exception, I do checks like if `argNotInteger` then I break from my switch case, else it will continue and run `getArgument`

So  my question is that, would it it be ok for me to test these only?
If its not, I am not so sure what I can test because those `getArgument` type functions are coded in the sense that those checks have already been run.
I am asking this since that the instructions were to test non trivial methods and that "the test code should try to catch most potential bugs in the target methods" but theres not much way to "break" something like `if(argNotInteger)` 
So would I get penalized?

@jovnc 
Does a "common parent" mean that the class will extend the exception handler?

To OP @Ruinim as well:
My views are that although having a dedicated exception handler might be "cleaner",
it could make the code less readable. i.e. the person reading the code does not get to see what exception is expected.
(Just imagine, if you have 20 exceptions, how do you know for that part of the code which exception(s) might hit ?) 

Of course, you could make it so that every exception is its own method which would reflect the expected exception.
But then there is a separate issue of what if in different parts of your code you would want different behaviour for the same exception?

Also, handling exceptions ASAP instead of passing it on to the caller function so that your debug log is not messy.

I am curious, what troubles did you have with implementation?

As for the implementation, we should never crash the program. 
As mentioned I would catch it in the callee, and then like you said, propagate an error message up.
This way if the end user expects output, you could still see something general while not revealing too much of your backend like 
"Error connecting with database, check your connection" 

I think it also goes beyond code and efficiency as I mentioned (and as such what you refer to as "which solution fits best for your use case")
To me code readability is important especially when you are working in a team.
For example in python, I would rather see a "normal" embedded for loop than a 3 tier list comprehension even if list comprehension is much more efficient.

I was thinking in terms of the parent class being what we would return to the user as an API service, so one of the last steps.
For immediate return, in the context of java we could return a null or an Optional Empty to the caller function.

Snippet of `deadline` switch case for my `.parse` function for my `InputParser` class
You can see that only if after all the checks did not break (i.e. it has no issues) then will I actually call `getTaskName` and the likes


```
        case "deadline":
            if (argKeywordNotFound(wordsList, "/by", command)) ``{``
                break;
            ``}``
            if (taskNameNotFound(wordsList,"/by", command)) ``{``
                break;
            ``}``
            if (noArgSupplied(wordsList, List.of("/by"),
                    "/by", "date", command)) ``{``
                break;
            ``}``
            taskName = getTaskName(wordsList, "/by");
            taskArg = getArg(wordsList, "/by","" );
            dateType = validDateType(taskArg);
            if (Objects.equals(dateType, ""))``{``
                break;
            ``}``
            argsList.add(taskArg);
            this.taskManager.addTask(command, taskName, argsList, isMarked, dateType);
            break;
```

`argKeywordNotFound` function
```
    private boolean argKeywordNotFound(List<String> wordsList, String argKeyword, String command)``{``
        // We are assuming command has already been verified.
        if (!wordsList.contains(argKeyword)) ``{``
            this.uiError.displayArgKeywordNotFound(argKeyword, command);
            return true;
        ``}``
        return false;
    ``}``
```

Although `validDateType` has a good few meaningful test cases, most of the functions are super atomic, so a test case would just be one positive (where the `argKeyword` is in the `wordsList`, maybe there could be two instances and it would be positive as well) and a negative test (where  `argKeyword` is not in the `wordsList`). 
And even then for the duplicated case, I would just add it as another function to check.
So there is not much space for meaningful tests.

A more meaningful test would probably be testing the actual switch cases, however that goes against a unit test based on my understanding. There is also no return available (task gets added).

Also, typing it out I just realized, most of the checker functions are private as well.
Only real solution i can think of is to use mocks to track that certain functions are called with certain arguments

@damithc hi prof, thanks for the answer!
i have a follow up question:
Are we expected to have user roles in user stories that would fit our target profile?
Because admittedly it seems like most of the TP projects are just upgraded AB3s with certain fields just being a more strict version of `remark`
i.e. many of the user stories would fit all users that would use an address book, and most of what would fit a targeted user can be done with a modified `remark` under a different field name. E.g. `class-id` for an AB3 targeted at NUS tutors

From what I understand for the point of having to write it in the UG - its for those features that might be obvious or intuitive.
E.g. if you can sort `name` alphabetically ascending, why does it not have descending order? 

Good question on second point though.
I would assume these are linked to sequence type errors. As in, its expected for the user to be able to do A->B->C 
perhaps because doing it in this order have some sort of expected outcome.
In this case, the user should still be able to do A->B->C, but the program should not crash.

An example of this would be the commonly reported ( i assume its common)   
"Edit JSON midway using app, but doing `list` does not show changes"
So editing JSON to update the contacts while app is running is not supported, however it does not cause the app to crash.

It is possible to operate under a directory where file creation and file reading is allowed, but not file write.
Since file creation is tied to directory write access control.
&hat; at least for linux.
This is what I believe the issue author can / will argue with.

Although, one can question if the user knows that his working directory does not have file write permissions, should he attempt to use a contact **storing** application? 
I do think its analogous to how a customer might argue that a comb is not suited for bald heads. 
Technically true, but practically it is no concern

Is there a way to model the second point "A and B depend on the same global variable" in a UML class diagram? Since I believe using association / dependency arrow does not really fit here (one does not hold the other indefinitely or temporarily).

I was thinking a singleton pattern could perhaps work here? since A and B could now point to one class where the global variable originate from. Please correct me if I'm wrong or if there are other methods!

It is mentioned in the notes:
> You can use **actor** generalization in use case diagrams using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.

I was wondering whether we could also use the UML notation for inheritance to show **use case generalisation** too. For example if I were to write a use case for an airplane seat booking system and there are two different seat types (say A and B);
* Should I create one general use case on how to book a seat and have two other use cases on how to book type A and B seat (if yes, would this warrant the usage of inheritance UML arrow notation?)
* Or would it be better to show booking type A and B seat as extensions in one use case? (using `<<extend>>` in the diagram)
* Or would it be better to separate the use case for type A and B seat booking?

**TLDR**; Is it acceptable to use the UML inheritance arrow notation in the use case diagram for use case generalisation?

I'm assuming if I still want to show the relationship of both Person and Cat from the example above, I need to draw two navigability arrow and not combine them into one bidirectional arrow like shown below:

<div align="center">
<img width="400" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0560a1c8-0bae-4b77-b38f-5d40b2e8a38f" />
</div>

So just clarifying, having more than one navigability arrow extending from one class to another and the other way around is allowed?

Following up on this, when would it be ok to have a bidirectional arrow as opposed to two arrows (if it's allowed)?

**4. :fas-info-circle: Association Vs Dependency - Usage Clarification**
</div>



It is mentioned in the textbook that

> An association is a relationship resulting from one object keeping a reference to another object (i.e., storing an object in an instance variable).

So does that mean if a class temporarily has access to another class (e.g. from a method parameter, local instantiation in a method, etc.), it would be better to model their relationship using a dependency arrow as opposed to an association arrow?

Another related question, if given a diagram where class A is connected to class B using an association line, is it safe to assume one of these are true:
* A has a field of type B
* B has a field of type A
* Both have field of the other type (i.e. the two points before this are true)

Or should we not make such assumptions?

Thank you so much for the quick reply prof @damithc ! May I ask a follow up question.

Are there any specific reason as to why we use the dependency arrow? Since I also came across diagrams that would use the dashed line + a triangle head to show a realisation of a generic class like the picture below:

I believe composition and aggregation do imply navigability. It is mentioned in the notes that:

<div align="center">
<img width="677" height="138" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba48681e-a0e3-4799-839a-369d2c2e1ccc" />
</div>

And we can use your examples on bookshelves and chessboard to see if aggregation and composition do imply navigability or not.

### Aggregation
Bookshelves need to know the books it holds as such they need to store it as a field, for example:

'''Java
public class Bookshelf ``{``
    private Book[] books;
``}``
'''

So this way, aggregation does imply navigability. I say this is aggregation because if we "delete" the bookshelf, these books can still "live" and be used.

### Composition
Similarly, chessboard might be implemented like this:

'''Java
public class Chessboard ``{``
    private Tiles[] tiles;
``}``
'''

Again, this composition relationship imply navigability as Chessboard object holds Tiles object as a field thus forming a structural relationship. I say this is composition because if we "delete" the chessboard, it would not make sense for the tiles to continue "living" on its own.

And so I believe you do not need to draw additional lines to show navigability if you are already using aggregation or composition.

Regarding these questions;

> 1. May I clarify what is meant by "acceptable for none of the alternative partitions to be executed"? Does this mean that the use of the sequence diagram in Figure 2 Option C is acceptable notation-wise to illustrate the flow of the program (since none of the alterative partition is executed)?
> 2. If the answer to 1 is YES, then does it mean for questions like the kind in Q22 above, we should also consider the intent of the code (obviously the code shows that it is indeed an optional path), when judging whether the diagram is acceptable (regardless of whether it is acceptable notation-wise)?

From [this source](https://www.softwareideas.net/sequence-diagram-opt-vs-alt) (I'm not sure if it's applicable in our course, though I assume it is since UML notations are agreed upon) `alt` must contain at least **two** mutually exclusive paths. In comparison, `opt` only has **one**. So I believe notation-wise, having just one path for `alt` is not acceptable.

Following up on these questions;

> 1. Does this imply that an alternative must have at least 2 partitions, and that one of them must be executed?
> 2. Therefore, it seems like the word "alternative partitions" in "acceptable for none of the alternative partitions to be executed", refer to partitions other than the first partition. Is this true?

As mentioned above, I do believe `alt` must have minimally **two** partitions/paths, but it is ok if none is executed, as mention in the notes;

> No more than one alternative partitions be executed in an alt frame. That is, **it is acceptable for none of the alternative partitions to be executed** but it is not acceptable for multiple partitions to be executed.

</div>

So navigability can be used in object diagrams.

As for labels and roles, I believe they are ok to be used in object diagrams since both labels and roles are used to describe/explain an associations and introducing them could improve readability of the diagram. (Although I'm unsure about this statement...)

I believe navigability is more suitable for the first statement. Since holding a variable (I'm assuming a field) of another class counts as a structural relationship and thus should be indicated by a navigability arrow (which would also imply association)

For the second statement, I agree with @nathantew14, I would assume calling a method from another class here means the other class is only temporary and thus dependency arrow is more fitting. But if the other class is a field then navigability would be more suitable.

For this question, I assume you meant removing `process()` from `Bar`. This will not cause a compile error and it will not break the inheritance. Just like what @dingf3ng mentioned, `process()` is not an abstract method in `Foo`, so removing `process()` from `Bar` will only cause any call to `Bar`'s `process()` to invoke the one in `Foo`.

If you meant removing `process()` from `Foo`, then compilation error **could** arise if you wrote `@override` above `process()` in `Bar`, like:

'''Java
public class Bar ``{``
    @Override
    public void process() ``{``...``}``
``}``
'''

Since the `@Override` annotation is meant to help you check whether you are overriding a parent's method correctly. Else, I don't think any error will arise if you remove `process()` from `Foo`.

> Hello chat , could I get some critiques on my diagram? Submitting my diagrams for discussion purposes as well!

Hi! Here are some suggestions I would give to improve your sequence diagram (These are all my opinions based on my answer, feel free to correct me too if I'm wrong!):
* Any incoming arrow (i.e. method calls) should be solid, the return arrow should be dashed
* Perhaps you should also include the invocation of `run()` pointing to the leftmost lifeline
* Line 1 is calling `f.create()` using the `f` that is passed through the method `run()`, as such, there is no need to draw the instantiation of `f` (Arrow head hitting the very top box of `f:Factory`). Instead, since it is calling the `create()` method, you should make the arrow hit the activation bar of `f`
* Remember that `opt` is used if there is only one path, in this question, we have two, using `alt` would be more appropriate     
   * The bottom right corner of the box encapsulating the word `alt` should be a bit chipped, like a folded paper 📄 
   * Don't forget to put the condition in square bracket (e.g. [status == 2])
   * Lines separating the paths of `alt` should be dashed instead of solid
   * I believe the activation bar inside the `alt` box should be continuous instead of being broken into two pieces
* (I'm a bit unsure about this one) This may be optional, but the lifeline of `u:Unit` could be ended after it's last return since it does not seem like `u` is being used anymore outside of the `run()` method

It would make sense (to me) that a container should know its contained(s) and a whole should know its parts. After all, what use is a bookshelf that can't access its books, or a chessboard that can't access its squares?

However, does composition and aggregation actually imply navigability (or do any of the other association traits imply navigability)? If not, should I draw multiple lines to also show the navigability of a composition association?

And in extension, which association traits are mutually exclusive? The [notes mention that](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/print.html#aggregation) aggregation is weaker than composition.

In [this part of the notes about navigability](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/print.html#navigability), the phrasing shifts from using "navigability" to to "association":

<img width="800" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb0dd835-d303-42c4-95b7-921470c5eb93" />

More importantly, it treats association as having direction; but from what I can tell, association should not be directional. This is supported by UML notation not having arrowheads for association lines:

(Yes I've also tried with the pdf download from Canvas)

Could this possibly be enhanced to allow easier use of the reference sheet?

There are some issues that we feel should fall undo `notInScope`, `rejected` or `issueNotClear`.

**8. :fas-info-circle: Is it a valid refactor to remove abstractions from the original code?**
</div>

Is it acceptable to remove abstractions that we find unnecessary in order to simplify the code? One trivial example is the `TypicalIndexes` class:

We find that it introduces cases where we want other indexes, and we end up having to add a bunch of indexes here, or mix the use of this with the direct `Index.fromOneBased` which is annoying and inconsistent

**9. :fas-info-circle: Is it just me, or is the amount of abstraction in this base repo quite excessive?**
</div>

I was following the [AddRemark tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html) a few weeks ago, but couldn't finish it due to failing tests. I actually tried to do the changes myself, either by hand or through AI. Eventually, after literal weeks , I finally resolved what seemed to be all issues, adding "remark" to every part of the code where it made sense.

The total damage? The change took what I can only estimate to be at least 20 (likely more) hours, and my sanity, tracing through convoluted stacktraces, countless levels of abstractions, [decrypting seemingly unrelated error messages](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/forum/issues/282), and putting logging everywhere in low level (in terms of abstraction) files like `ModelManager` to check what went wrong.

In total, I changed 31 files and over 700 lines of code ([PR for reference](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-1/tp/pull/61/files#diff-d4f866929b94861826172b908454d075d15d94c5e6fd3d226028e769ea60f4db)). FOR A SINGLE NEW FIELD IN THE PERSON CLASS. And this `Remark` field is literally as basic as it could possibly get. From the Remark class itself, to commands, parsers, equality checks, toStrings, tokenizers, dummy data, testing code, testing utils, the list goes on and on and on.

This feels a little (extremely) excessive, especially for an intro to Software Engineering. I've worked on multiple IRL products before, and none were nearly this complex, despite having far more functionality. Am I doing something wrong? Does anyone feel the same way?

(I realised that the Remark field is meant to be optional, which may have made this particular change easier, but my point still stands for adding a new compulsory field)

**10. :fas-info-circle: Ambiguous NoSuchElementException after updating Person to support Remark**

I followed the Week 6 tP tutorial to introduce the Remark field to AB3 up till updating all occurrences of Person to use Remark [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html#update-other-usages-of-person). The previous all-tests-passed checkpoint is at [adding parser for Remark](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html#parse-user-input).

Unfortunately, I then got these ambiguous errors from a seemingly unrelated test suite for the `LogicManager` about `NoSuchElementException`:

I didn't manage to find anything useful in the StackTrace, and I can't seem to make any debugging or logging tools work with running tests (in VSCode).

Has anyone come across this? Or any suggestions to find the issue?

**11. :fas-info-circle: VSCode refuses to recognise my iP as a Java project after I moved it into another folder**

My project WAS ready for submission, but then I reorganised some folders and now everything is broken. Redhat for Java refuses to recognise my project as a Java project and compilation checks don't work.

### Things I've tried
1. Ran the VSCode command:  `Developer: Reload Window`
2. Ran the VSCode command: `Java: Clean the Java language server workspace` (from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61826895/how-to-avoid-visual-studio-code-warning-myfile-java-is-a-non-project-file-o))
3. Explicitly opened my project folder as a Java project by clicking the prompt in the bottom right panel5. 
4. Created a new Java project in my current folder via the VSCode Redhat extension.
5. Checked for any absolute filepaths to my previous project directory in my workspace (there were none)3. Restarted VSCode
6. Disabled and restarted all Java-related extensions
7. Copied the project back to its original location and tried opening that instead
8. Restarted my MacBook
9. Re-cloned the latest working version from my forked repo
10. Rolled back my broken project workspace to the last commit before we introduced our changes:

<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e34cfc4d-cca7-4f1d-acc1-38a08c5978d6" />

11. Removed the `.gradle` folder which is the only difference between the 2 windows above – oh. That made VSCode recognise the Java project. BUT this still doesn't work in my original project. After deleting the folder, VSCode still does not recognise the Java project, and eventually re-generates the `.gradle` file.
12. Removed the `.vscode` folder
13. Uninstalled all Java-related extensions: Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat, Gradle for Java, Debugger for Java, Project Manager for Java, Extension Pack for Java, Tester Runner for Java, clicked "Restart Extensions", then quit and re-opened VSCode.
14. I'm out of ideas.

Firstly, from what I can tell (mostly with gpt), the 3 checkout steps are redundant – only the last one matters, and it also has a really misleading name, "Merge to master", when it's not doing any merging at all. Furthermore, the [v4/v5 github checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout) already checks out the commit that triggered the workflow by default, so a simple checkout would have been sufficient.

Secondly, the "Validate Gradle Wrapper" step fails if you did not commit your `gradle-wrapper.jar` file. I'm not sure if I missed something, or did something weird that most students wouldn't naturally do, but I followed [this part](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week2/topics.html#t2l6-omitting-files-from-revision-control) of the Topics on Revision Control and removed the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file from Git, which of course causes the wrapper validation to fail.

Lastly, [this documentation](https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/main/docs/wrapper-validation.md) seems to say that the `setup-gradle` action from `v4` onwards already automatically validates wrapper jar files, so it seems that that step is also unnecessary and could just be a comment?

**13. :fas-info-circle: Running with Gradle in VSCode throws error**
</div>

Yeah, yeah. They said to use IntelliJ. I hated learning a whole new IDE that I would never use again, so here I am.

My project works just fine when running with Java. With `./gradlew run`, it's a little strange because there's some status thing in the command line that blocks the "interface", but `./gradlew run --console=plain` fixes that:

<img width="514" height="197" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c1acbc-9dee-4340-a98f-83de8945a2f3" />

The problem is when I try to run the application using the VSCode Gradle for Java extension, with its "Run a Gradle Build" command in the command palette:

<img width="618" height="375" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa79c306-d9a1-4791-bf45-c65ce9b6e303" />

I tried both "run" and "run --console=plain":

They both fail with slightly differing outputs:

<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17e4338a-374c-4fcd-8c74-36fc8431a8e5" />

Is this a me problem, a Gradle problem, or a problem of the Gradle for Java VSCode extension? Has anyone tried doing it this way? Is it even necessary to run the project this way, or can I just stick to running it with Java/the command line command that worked?

Thanks.

I can't speak for others, but I really can't imagine having to change 30+ files just to add a single command if I did not already have years of experience before this. Maybe I'm underestimating how fast others learn, but it definitely feels like a humongous jump from 2030's level of complexity to this.

@damithc thank you! Then to follow up, is "association" a more generic/abstract term, such that dependencies, navigability, composition and aggregation are more specific forms/subtypes of associations? Or should I see them as separate entities at equal levels (as in equal complexity/equal level in the hierarchy of ideas)

I'm probably gonna be judged for being obnoxiously excessive/tryhard, but I guess this is good practice for drawing UML as well:

Can I confirm that what you mean can be represented by this:

<img width="1014" height="729" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d3b584c-e94c-4c43-abd3-e21f4d631817" />

If so, [this part](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/print.html#dependencies) of the notes on dependency doesn't seem to make sense if you treat dependency as a trait of associations:

<img width="734" height="238" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12eb4d7b-a2a4-498f-ab19-1d0eb6548e67" />

If dependency is just a trait of a associations, what does it mean for a relationship between 2 classes to "[not have a] direct association in the same direction"? What does "direct association" mean?

(On a side not, thank you so much for the engaging discussion!)

It would seem that associations are only when the class keeps a reference to another class (I assume that's what's meant by the first statement in the question, "the class contains a variable from another class").

If the class calls a method from another class, it would probably be a dependency instead.

I found [this snippet](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/print.html#modeling-dependencies) about dependency vs associations:

<img width="767" height="248" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38e44b51-f647-497b-a7b9-edbb091e5a0e" />

> association is a relationship resulting from one object keeping a reference to another object

So this makes it seem like associations, on their own, already imply some navigability? But if the line is drawn without arrows, then the nature of the navigability is just not made explicit?

How do we show navigability on top of other association traits like composition and aggregation then? Do we draw a separate arrow? Is that valid notation under UML rules?

It seems that all associations already imply dependence, but the dependence line is omitted as it does not add information:

> we need not show that as a dependency arrow in the class diagram if the association is already indicated in the diagram. That is, showing a dependency arrow does not add any value to the diagram.

However, I also have the same doubts regarding the direction of dependence, as with the direction of navigability. How do we make it clear if the association line is already showing a more "important" association?

**1. :fas-info-circle: How can we dispute duplicate issue?**
</div>

Hi, I would like to clarify on how we can dispute duplicate issue.

Is it possible to dig into their codebase and proof that the fix for the bug for both issues are independent? ie. proof that the fix of bug A can be done independently of bug B from their code.

Would this be good evidence to dispute duplicate issue?

For reference, this is the definition of duplicates defined in CS2103T, where bugs cannot be fixed independently.

First, it seems that your `gitmastery` is not installed properly, likely because you installed the wrong binary. If you are using a Mac, make sure to follow the Mac installation instructions, not the Windows version. 

Recommend using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) if you are on a Mac.

Second, `cd ../my-projects` is a placeholder, `cd` means change directory. You can use `ls` command to list all the directories available to `cd` into.

Here's a possible implementation that seems clean to me, atleast for Input Processing.

1) Have a common parent for all classes that will handle all exceptions
2) All other classes will propagate their errors to the parent (by rethrowing the errors, possibly create custom exceptions)
3) Handle errors at the parent, eg. print error message to CLI

Feel free to share any thoughts.

Sorry, maybe using a wrong terminology here, as it can get confused with OOP inheritance. 

What I actually had in mind was something like having a main class responsible for input handling, which would also be the central place to catch and manage exceptions. That way, all the other classes can propagate their errors up to this class, and the decision for how to handle them (e.g., logging or printing error messages) is made in one place.

'''java
class A ``{``
    try ``{``
        // handle input here
    ``}`` catch (ExceptionA e) ``{``
        // centralized handling
    ``}`` catch (ExceptionB e) ``{``

    ``}``
``}``
'''

The idea is just to keep exception handling consistent by managing it in a central layer, rather than having every class deal with it separately.

> 

I have considered that approach, and it definitely is sound. However, I had some troubles implementing that and thus stuck to the "global" exception handling approach.

Here's a a few things you might want to note when implementing that:
- how should you handle the exception in child classes? 
- eg. you have a handleTask function that uses a child class to parse the input string, create the task, etc. How should the child class propagate the error message up? Do you just crash the program, or should handleTask return an error message instead

I think it also ultimately depends on how you structure your program, to see which solution fits best for your use case.

I considered the implementation you mentioned, where I handle it in the child class, by returning a 'String' as an error message, instead of propagating the error up the hierarchy.

However, it seemed awkward to return a 'String' to me, as that's not what I would expect the function to return. From the 'parent' class point of view, it seems like there was no error to begin with (even though it should be an error, that is handled).

Furthermore, what if the error occurs in a class with a function that doesn't return a 'String'? eg. DateUtils to parse date strings, where the function should return LocalDate object.

But yes, I do agree that handling errors where it first occurs does seem cleaner in terms on thinking about the logic of it. I guess there are tradeoffs to each implementation.

Hi, it appears that your tag for Level-5 and Level-6 does not belong to the `master` branch in your repository. Your previous tags do not have this issue, thus it can be picked up in iP dashboard page.

Level-5 tag:
<img width="954" height="525" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fce562e-83af-4c1d-b944-874949eb11a4" />

Here's the fix:
1. delete the tag locally

`git tag -d Level-5`

2. delete the tag from the remote

`git push origin --delete Level-5`

3. find the relevant commit you want to tag it

`git log --oneline`

4. tag the relevant commit

`git tag <COMMIT-HASH>`

5. push the tag

`git push origin Level-5`

> I have shifted from using text-ui-test (input.txt and expected.txt) to JUnit for a more automated testing approach.
> 
> text-ui-test was useful before saving was implemented as there was no memory involved so outputs were always consistent. However, with the introduction of a file to save to and load from, it is more practical to utilize JUnit for future testing as it allows you to test individual features in a more stable and automated manner.

JUnit is useful for unit testing, ie. testing individual classes and methods. However, it cannot simulate entire user flows for proper integration / E2E testing, ie. to ensure that components interacts with each other as intended. Therefore, it is important to have both to ensure that your application is well tested.

If I'm not wrong, `data/rio.ser` should be placed at the root of the directory, not under `resources` directory

When running from a JAR file:
The resources folder and its contents are bundled inside the JAR file. A JAR is essentially a zip archive. The path `resources/data/rio.ser` no longer points to a file on the operating system's file system. Instead, it's an entry within the JAR archive itself. As a result, any code trying to access it as a java.io.File will fail, usually with a `FileNotFoundException`.

It is not to say that aggregation is completely useless, as some relationships might be better explained with aggregation > composition, eg. university and students, where parts can exist independently of the whole.

However, the main concern is that aggregation’s semantics are rather weak and easily confused with either association or composition. Because aggregation does not enforce any specific behaviour or constraints in code and does not define clear rules regarding object lifecycle, its use can be ambiguous and may not add much practical value to the model.

While it can be tedious, I think that such a design may be a necessary evil, especially for large software projects in enterprise settings. There could of course be other ways to structure things (eg. MVC) but each with its drawbacks.

However, once you get familiar with the codebase (that means actually hand implementing the code, and with the use of AI), you should be able to navigate the codebase with ease. Take the first PR as a way to get familiar with the codebase, and write it manually.

Side note: this is also the reason why onboarding new developers to existing codebases in enterprise settings can take weeks and even months

I think it would be better to give an example.

'''java
public class Car ``{``
    private Engine engine; // Engine is associated with Car (Car keeps a reference)

    public Car(Engine engine) ``{`` // Car depends on Engine for construction (temporary usage) - but stores in permanently as field (association)
        this.engine = engine;
    ``}``
``}``
'''

In the class diagram, you should only show the association (solid line) from Car to Engine. This is because the association (field reference) implies that Car depends on Engine for its functionality.

'''java
public class CarService ``{``
    public void repair(Car car) ``{`` // CarService depends on Car (temporary usage, not stored anywhere in CarService)

    ``}``
``}``
'''

However, for the case above, it only shows dependency (temporary usage).

Do correct me if I'm wrong, thanks!

EP itself does not state explicitly that you **should** only have one test per partition (can refer to the notes)

In the ideal case, you want to test all possibilities + 100% path coverage to ensure you are 100% bug-free. But of course this is just not practical, as each test case comes with a cost (time to write the test case + time to run it in the CI). What EP gives us is a way to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our tests (smth like the Pareto Principle, how can we achieve 80% results with 20% effort).

Fundamentally, having a bidirectional arrow has a different meaning from two arrows.

Bidirectional arrow means that `Cat` and `Person` are navigable from each other, ie. if `PersonA` is linked to `CatB`, then `CatB` must be linked to `PersonA`.

Two arrows mean two distinct, independent relationships, eg. `PersonA` is linked to `CatB`, but `CatB` is not necessarily linked to `PersonA`, it can be linked to `PersonC` instead

So, it really depends on what message you are trying to convey from the class diagram.

I think it really depends on the context.

In this case of a logger, I would think it is over-engineering to extract out `Exception thrown` to another literal, as its just logging. But for other cases, where perhaps the string is a core part of the functionality, it could be better to extract it out, but really depends on context.

In the context of Java, Java is OOP in nature, thus everything has to live inside classes (ignoring Java 25).

Thus, the global variable has to live inside another class `C`. Here's an example below.

'''java
class C ``{``
    public static int GLOBAL_VAR = 10;
``}``

class A ``{``
    public void foo() ``{``
        System.out.println("GLOBAL_VAR: " + C.GLOBAL_VAR);
    ``}``
``}``

class B ``{``
    public void bar() ``{``
        System.out.println("GLOBAL_VAR: " + C.GLOBAL_VAR);
    ``}``
``}``
'''

From the class diagram perspective, this would mean A and B depend on C.

It may seem like there is no coupling here, since the A has no direct arrows to B. However, consider the case where I want to update A to print `20` instead of `10`. Because they rely on the same global variable, I would unknowingly be changing the B to print `20` as well.

**5. :fas-info-circle: Emojis are displayed as garbled characters**

Hi,
I tried to include emojis for my chatbot to match it's character but the emoji in shown as garbled characters. How do I use emojis correctly?
I've given a snippet of my code here:

'''java
public String showExit()``{``
        return "Byeee 👋";
 ``}``
'''

The output in the UI:

Hi,

I went through the notes and examples on JUnit testing, but I noticed that most of my chatbot's methods are void and print output to the console. Since the examples given focus on testing return values and exceptions, I’m unsure how to approach testing these void methods.

**8. :fas-info-circle: IP Level 7: Handling Previously Saved Tasks**
</div>

Hi,
For this week's IP requirement (Level 7), when I run the program again, it correctly appends new todos to the .txt file. However, I noticed that only the tasks added during the current run are in the Arraylist. So, if I added 3 tasks in the first run and 1 in the second, the program only recognises the tasks from the latest run. Trying to mark or delete one of the earlier tasks (e.g., mark 2) results in an error because the program doesn’t see those previous tasks.
Am I supposed to modify the program to be able to interact with tasks across multiple runs, or is that outside the scope of this week's requirement?

Regarding the week 1 quiz question, "In inheritance, a class is not allowed to inherit directly from multiple other classes (i.e., multiple inheritance)."

I wanted to clarify whether it is referring specifically to Java or to object-oriented programming in general. The answer depends on the language, since multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java but is supported in languages like Python. Which scope is the question based on?

Tested the features, and everything appears as intended. UI elements render correctly, functionality behaves as expected, and no glitches are observed during use. 

Just noticed a small typo: In the start of the convo, the first welcome message says to type ENHYPEN followed by the title track, but in the help command, it says enhypen TITLE_TRACK.

I believe there's a small issue with the deadline command. The date format is contradictory in the error message. In the message, it says HHmm in the example, it's 12:34 (colon is also included). I think you may want to check into that.

**1. :fas-info-circle: DG.pdf formatting issue when exporting as PDF**

During the PE-D, our team came across a bug reported by a tester that we did not include spacing between extensions for certain use cases in Developer Guide. We accepted it and wanted to resolve it.

<img width="682" height="196" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddcf8a14-ffdb-46f4-9ead-36a717afa9ba" />

However, upon checking both our [DeveloperGuide.md](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md?plain=1#L642) (linked to UC07 in DeveloperGuide.md file) file and the online [Developer Guide](https://ay2526s1-cs2103-f10-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#use-cases), we found that we actually did include the necessary spacing and the bug brought up by the tester was not present. We found that this formatting issue is only present when we try to export the Developer Guide as a PDF using the technique suggested by the teaching team. Attached is an image of the issue occurring when viewing the DG.pdf file.

Hence, we would like to check, in this case, given that we are willing to accept and resolve this bug but are actually unable to (due to the issue not being present in the md file or online DG), are we required to solve this issue or is it actually a non-issue and we are thus allowed to close it?

Have you fetched the `add-gradle-support` branch from your forked repo? You can check whether you have done so by checking if the `add-gradle-support` branch exists currently on your local repo by running the command `git branch -a` and seeing whether the branch `add-gradle-support` is present.

If you have yet to fetch the branch from the forked repo, you can run the following commands:
```
git fetch origin
git switch -c add-gradle-support origin/add-gradle-support
```
The commands listed above and what they are doing can be found [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/project.html#4-add-increments-a-moreoop-a-packages-a-gradle-a-junit-a-jar)

Lastly, you just need to merge the `add-gradle-support` branch to your `master` branch.
```
git checkout master
git merge add-gradle-support

From the GFMD tasks mentioned over [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#1-use-gfmd-in-the-pr-description), it seems that your current PR description has yet to complete all the specified requirements. I've proceeded to strikethrough what I can see has been completed:
1. a heading
2. ~~a bullet list~~
3. ~~a numbered list~~
4. a fenced code block (with syntax highlighting)
5. ~~a task list~~
6. ~~an emoji~~
7. a blockquote
8. ~~a hyperlink~~
9. inline code
10. some text formatting: bold, italic, strikethrough etc.

Perhaps you could try completing the remaining requirements and check if the dashboard detects the completion of the task? To simplify things, you could reference the example PR description provided [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#dukepro), it should contain all the required elements for the GFMD task.

To pass the `Git Standard` tag, your last 5 commits should satisfy the Git Standards mentioned [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html). It also mentions that your commit messages should not be too short (can't seem to find the minimum length) and should not exceed the hard limit of 72 characters.

<img width="1390" height="868" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8d2949f-0e7a-41f5-a7a1-5cc1df2790a5" />

Taking a look at your past 5 commits, the highlighted commit message has exceeded the hard limit, having 98 characters and your 5th most recent commit also does not use the imperative mood.

<img width="1301" height="527" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d9e4baa-fa1b-4fac-a630-614eb4069d67" />

As for how you can go about rectifying it, you could push 2 commits to your remote repository on GitHub that satisfy the course's Git conventions (I recommend just continue making commits as per normal, no need to purposely push 2 commits that serve no purpose and "mess up" your repo's commit history).

As you merged `master` branch to `branch-A-Streams` branch, this means that all code that is found in the `master` branch will be merged into the `branch-A-Streams` branch. Since the `master` branch itself does not contain the code for streams feature (as we/you did your work for streams in a separate branch), therefore the `master` branch does not contain code that utilise streams.

To proceed to add the code that utilises streams to your `master` branch, since the code that utilises stream is found in your `branch-A-Streams` branch, you can either (follow option 2 instead since the increment suggests doing it this way):
1. `git checkout master` to switch to your `master` branch
- proceed to `git merge branch-A-Streams --no-ff` to merge code done in `branch-A-Streams` branch (code that utilises streams) to your `master` branch 
- `git push origin master` to push your local repo's `master` branch to your remote repo
- note that this approach is **not recommended** since this increment is to get you to practice creating pull requests (PR) in your own forked repository

2. create a PR within your fork on GitHub (from `branch-A-Streams` to `master` branch)- merge the PR on GitHub and choose the Create merge commit option when merging
- this will cause the `master` branch of your local repo to fall behind that of your fork, therefore, you need to sync the local `master` with the remote `master` branch 
- to do that, switch to the local `master` branch and then pull the updated `master` branch from your fork e.g.,
```
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```
- lastly, tag the merge commit as usual, and push to the fork

Your screenshot of your GUI is currently named `UI.png` in your repo whereas in your `README`, you are referencing the file name `Ui.png`. Renaming the `UI.png` file in your repo to `Ui.png` should render the image just fine.

If the above still does not work, try referencing the image file using `./Ui.png` instead, which is what I wrote for my `README`.

Could you check if you are in the right branch (`master`) by doing `git status` and posting a screenshot of the output. Additionally, `git status` would also tell us if you have added this change to the staging area. It is possible that you made the change on your local repo in IntelliJ but did not push the changes over to your remote repo on GitHub.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm assuming that all that needs to be changed is the name of your tag from `A-BetterGUI` to `A-BetterGui` and your branch name is perfectly fine.

If that's the case, you could
1. delete the `A-BetterGUI` tag on your local repo
2. delete the `A-BetterGUI` tag on your remote repo
3. tag your merge PR commit as `A-BetterGui`
4. push the new tag to your remote repo

To achieve that you can do the following commands
```
git tag -d A-BetterGUI // deletes the tag on your local repo
git push origin --delete A-BetterGUI // deletes the tag on your remote repo
git tag HEAD~2 A-BetterGui // since your merge PR commit was the 3rd most recent commit, we tag HEAD~2 instead
git push origin --tags // pushes the updated tag from your local repo to your remote repo
```

Edit: change `HEAD~1` to `HEAD~2` since merge PR commit is now the 3rd most recent commit

Functionalities tested:
1. list
2. todo
3. deadline
4. event
5. find
6. mark
7. unmark
8. delete
9. saving and loading tasks from save file (created task, marked as complete, exit and re-opened app)

Comments: Tested the different functionalities listed above and mark, unmark and delete were able to handle invalid and valid task indexes as expected. New Todos and Deadlines were able to be created and formatted properly. However, new Events do not seem to show the proper date time format (`MMM dd yyyy HH:mm`) for its `from` and `to` date. Lastly, saving and loading tasks were able to work as expected.

As @CelineTj16 has mentioned, you would need to rename your `UI.png` file to `Ui.png` file instead. Refer to #176 for a similar issue.

As for Use GFMD, you would need to use GitHub Flavoured Markdown (GFMD) for your Pull Request (PR) description as your [current PR description](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/ip/pull/571) is empty. You may refer to this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to get started on GFMD. The requirements for the GFMD increment can be found [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#1-use-gfmd-in-the-pr-description) along with an example of what your PR description should look like.

Took a quick look at your `README`, and I think it seems to be missing a fenced code block (with syntax highlighting).
In the example provided, the image below is what it should look like.

<img width="897" height="180" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ded278d-0159-433b-b0f7-9282f27dd633" />

I believe your PR description currently only has inline code. To include a fenced code block with syntax highlighting, you may refer to [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting).

But yes, I think after including the fenced code block, and copy pasting your `README` over to your PR description, it should meet the Use GFMD requirement.

@llamawithhats I do think that issue could be classified as `response.NotInScope`. While you have correctly identified that this problem arises only under extreme user behaviour, where a name exceeds 100 characters, such cases are highly unlikely to occur in normal usage. Nonetheless, it would be reasonable for future versions to handle this more gracefully by imposing a `MAX_LENGTH` constraint and displaying an appropriate error message on the GUI when the limit is exceeded. Since this potential enhancement was not within the team’s current design considerations or priorities for this release, it is more appropriate to classify this issue as `response.NotInScope` rather than `response.Rejected`.

@llamawithhats I believe it is in the team’s best interest to provide a clear team response for any changes (in the image) made. While the reason for marking an issue as a duplicate may seem obvious to the developers, it might not be as clear to the testers or teaching team. Failing to include an explanation introduces ambiguity and leaves the interpretation open to others, which may not work in the team’s favour. When in doubt, it is always better to include a short justification explaining why the issue is considered a duplicate. This helps ensure that your intent is properly understood and increases the likelihood that the testers and teaching team will agree with your reasoning.

> Is this because Action is an abstract class, hence it need not explicitly show its inherited `repeat()` method?

Not sure whether there is a source for this (maybe it was covered in a tutorial or nested somewhere in the textbook) but for Class Diagrams, methods (in this case `repeat()` method) are only included in the child class if it has been overridden. So, to answer this question, no, it is not because `Action` is an abstract class, but because `Action` class does not modify / override the `repeat()` method inherited from the `Repeatable` interface. 

It is totally possible for an abstract class `Action` to override the `repeat()` method and thus we would need to include the `repeat()` method under its operations, in the class diagram. Hence, it is not to do with the fact that `Action` is an abstract class but because it does not override the `repeat()` method.

> If the `repeat()` method was shown inside the abstract class, will it be deemed wrong?

That would depend on whether `Action` class did in fact override the `repeat()` method and have its own implementation. Judging from the code snippet attached above, it seems as if the `Action` class does not override the `repeat()` method, thus including it in the abstract class would be incorrect, since it would suggest that `Action` class did in fact override the `repeat()` method and have its own implementation

~~**Note:** my answer is based off the understanding that including inherited methods in child classes means that they override the parent class's methods, so I may be incorrect~~

Edit: This was covered in one of the tutorials, T8, on drawing UML class diagrams

@TheresiaOng @iZUMi-kyouka I disagree that the activation bar inside the `alt` box should be continuous (i.e. they should be separated). In the question, we either execute `f.increase(2)` or `f.increase(3)` which are two different `increase(x)` method calls. Activation bars show the period for which a method is being executed. By joining the activation bars, we are saying that both `increase(2)` and `increase(3)` methods have the same activation bar and are being executed for the same period, which should not be the case given that we either execute `increase(2)` or `increase(3)`, both of which are two different function invocations. Hence, I believe separating the activation bars is correct here.

As for the TaskList sequence diagram shown in the video, the reason why the activation bar is not being separated is because the `generate()` method either calls `getTask()` method or invokes the `Task` constructor. Hence, it would be correct to not split the activation bar for that question.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on alt use in sequence diagram**
</div>

UPDATE: consider my latest post below first

<img width="959" height="650" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1816c8fa-7191-4546-9275-57449d5ba268" />
Figure 1

The note states that **it is acceptable for none of the alternative partitions to be executed but it is not acceptable for multiple partitions to be executed.**

Now consider this question in Week 8 Quiz Part 1 Q22.

<img width="965" height="672" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d95993-361b-4e5c-a58f-c409e5f44530" />
Figure 2

It says that C is wrong since the code represents an optional path rather than an alternative. 

These are the questions I have.
1. May I clarify what is meant by "acceptable for none of the alternative partitions to be executed"? Does this mean that the use of the sequence diagram in Figure 2 Option C is acceptable notation-wise to illustrate the flow of the program (since none of the alterative partition is executed)?
2. If the answer to 1 is YES, then does it mean for questions like the kind in Q22 above, we should also consider the intent of the code (obviously the code shows that it is indeed an optional path), when judging whether the diagram is acceptable (regardless of whether it is acceptable notation-wise)?

Thank you.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on disagreeing with duplicate flagging**
</div>

Sorry if this is quite late, I just realised this. 



Dev team chooses to mark my bug as a duplicate to another bug. However, this "another bug" is less specific i.e. it contains 2 independently fixable issues in ONE issue, and one of 2 issues is a duplicate of the issue I am reporting.

Let's say the following
My issue: Feature A has a problem
Dev team flagged my issue a a duplicate of another issue: Feature A and B has problems.

Dev team does not provide any justification as to why my issue is a duplicate of the other issue, nor does the dev team respond to the original issue (dev team does not discard one of the issue). 

In this event, do I still need to object to the duplicate, just in case the issue that "Feature A has problem" got discarded by the teacher? Or does this mean the teacher will consider both issues are accepted by the dev (and thus I do not need to object to the duplicate)?

In short, I just want to check if I objecting to the duplicate is fine in case "Feature A has problem" is deemed to be discarded from the "parent issue", in which case, my issue becomes another different issue

This concerns a bug that is rejected. However, I am not sure what to do if the dev team argues for a severity downgrade (by changing label) but does NOT provide any justification. If I disagree with the downgrade, do I still object by writing a response? Or does this mean their attempt to downgrade severity is invalid since they do not provide any justification?

It is mentioned somewhere in the course website that penalty for bugs depends on severity, type, as well as bug density. It is also mentioned that "some bugs might not even be penalised"

Seems like there are many factors involved here. Is the teaching team able to provide some guidelines / reference, for example, regarding how many bugs (and of which severity) per some number of LoC are considered good (and therefore no penalty) and at which point is the bug density considered exceeding the maximum bar (penalty starts to be applied)?

Suppose I have 2 similar issues.

1. May I confirm that the following: "the dev team edits line 5-10 (assuming these lines are related e.g. all in the same method) of a file F in response to these issues, and these **2 issues are fixed**" qualify for  "fixing one fixes the others automatically"?

2. Therefore, may I confirm that the following sentence
    - "editing some lines in class A fixed one of the issue, and then to fix the other issue, the dev team still needs to edit class B (which is unrelated to A)" means that **these 2 issues are independently fixable** and therefore **CANNOT** be considered duplicate?

3.  May I further confirm that reporting similar issues of identical severity (but are indepently fixable) does not reduce marks? (as compared to reporting more diverse issues of identical severity)? e.g. two severity medium that are independently fixable but similar in nature VS two severity medium of features that are unrelated (and both are independently fixable)

From this information alone, I would think that this is a dependency.  A `Consumer` is a function that performs operation on many `ClassB`. You may have such function without having any actual reference to `ClassB` or even `List&lt;ClassB>`. However, `ClassA` could still depend on, for example, instance methods in `ClassB` since you may call these methods in the `Consumer`. e.g. `Consumer&lt;List&lt;ClassB>> c = lst -&gt; ``{`` lst.stream().map(ClassB::someClassMethod); ``}```;

> [@iZUMi-kyouka](https://github.com/iZUMi-kyouka) Here is an outline of how the penalty is calculated. Numbers are examples only, as we need to tweak the numbers every semester, due to changes that can influence PE performance of students (for example, this time we gave 24 hours for testing whereas in previous semesters we gave only 1.5 hours).
> 
> First, we calculate a maximum penalty range for each student, based on the implementation effort of that student. For example, Alice: 4 Jane (did twice as much implementation work as Alice): 8
> 
> Then, we calculate the penalty accumulated by each student (based on bugs assigned to the student): Alice: 0.15x2 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.75 = 1.8 → used up 45% of her penalty range i.e., 1.8/4 Jane: 0.15x4 + 0.25 + 0.5x2 + 0.75 = 2.6 → used up 33% of her penalty range i.e., 2.6/8
> 
> We 'forgive' a portion of the bugs e.g., 20% of the bugs. Alice's penalised bug percentage: 45-20=25% Jane's penalised bug percentage: 33-20=13%
> 
> If there are 10 marks for this component, Alice's score = 10_75% = 7.5 Jane's score = 10_87% = 8.7

@damithc Sorry if it is unclear. My intention is that, the website only specifies what should I do if team rejects, does not provide justification, and I do not agree with the rejection.

My specific situation is the following: team **downgrades severity** (but still accepts the bug), does **not** provide justification, and I disagree with the downgrade.

In this situation, do I still need to object to the downgrade by adding a comment?

1. Does this imply that an alternative must have at least 2 partitions, and that one of them must be executed?

@TheresiaOng Thank you for your reply! I agree with you. This [article](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/the-sequence-diagram/) also states the same thing you mentioned about the restriction on the partitions. 

Basically, opt, from the definition, should only contain 1 partition. Beyond that, it becomes an alt and vice versa.

Agree with the ending of u:Unit's lifeline after the method call to `pad` returns, since the reference to u is never returned, and there will be no reference to it after the method `run` returns.

Regarding the joining of the activation bar throughout the alt partition, is there a convention? I think one of the worked example has something similar to this, and in the model answer, it is indeed joined.

I understand the [course website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week11/project.html#1-alpha-test-the-product) asked us to alpha-test using the JAR file.

If our teammates have already made changes to the features we wish to test via a PR (that is yet to be merged), may we do alpha-testing by locally checking out their PR and running the code (say, using`./gradlew clean run`) instead of testing using the `v1.4` JAR file? I feel it would be more productive to alpha-test the features after changes in the PRs rather than their pre-PR changes in the `v1.4` JAR file.

I understand we can use make a new release (such as `v1.4.1`) and use that for alpha testing, but it may take some time before the PRs are actually merged and a new release is made, and so we can work faster if we just.

To clarify, the above will be done on top of (rather than to replace) testing that the JAR file can be opened using the PE steps.

**4. :fas-info-circle: Giving credit for changes spanning many files**
</div>



I understand from the [course website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/appendixB-policies.html#giving-credit-for-reused-work) that we must give credit when we refer to tP code by a current student from a different team.

How should I give credit for code adapted from a coursemate (from different team) when the code changes span across many different files?

Context: I'm updating an existing command to add sorting logic. I met a bunch of runtime errors in my own attempts and had trouble finding a solution online, so I decided to refer to other teams to see if they implemented anything similar. I saw the [changes in this PR by a fellow coursemate](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/pull/140/files) (thanks AndrescuIII-too!) and will be implementing similar changes for my PR.

However, the changes I plan to make will likely just be inspired by a few lines of code in different Java files (for example, see the diffs in the `logic` and `model` packages in the PR linked above). Also, some changes involve a few lines of codes changes across different locations in the same Java file (for example, see [file diffs for ModelManager.java](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/pull/140/files#diff-7bd09b3a54ed83a93060f9d5e74302f5affc224dd83cb8ae73eafa10a999930d))

How should I give credit? Must I add the `//Solution below inspired by …` comment to all the different files I change? Is there a simpler way I can do this (say, giving credit in a commit message or PR description, or adding a comment like `// Code for sorting in this file and others inspired by …` at just one location)?

**5. :fas-info-circle: Checkstyle does not exclude checks for missing Javadoc for some constructors**
</div>

## Background

The [tP upstream repo (AB3) `checkstyle.xml`](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/tp/blob/bd6718b2d6d7ca209ce08a9c33955687dfff97d9/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml#L411) explicitly excludes checking for missing Javadoc header comments for constructors.

According to [this StackOverflow answer on ignoring Javadoc validation for constructors](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32319169), the way the AB3 handles such exclusion appears to be correct.

## Problem

Not all constructors are actually excluded by this Checkstyle check.

Based on some light testing, it appears that any changes to constructor implementation beyond just having straightforward `this.&lt;fieldName> = &lt;paramName>;` lines will cause Checkstyle to no longer ignore that constructor for Javadoc-related checks.

For example:

* The constructor below (taken from base AB3) is ignored by Checkstyle (that is, Checkstyle will _not_ raise an error saying it is missing a Javadoc comment).

'''java
public FindCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate) ``{``
    this.predicate = predicate;
``}``
'''

* The constructors below will _not_ be ignored by Checkstyle (that is, Checkstyle will raise an error saying it is missing a Javadoc comment).

'''java
public FindCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate) ``{``
    requireNonNull(predicate);
    this.predicate = predicate;
``}``
// OR
public FindCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate) ``{``
    this.predicate = predicate;
    int i = 1 + 1;
``}``
'''

Does anyone know how to amend Checkstyle to exclude _all_ constructors from Javadoc-related checks (other than manually adding the file name and line no. for each constructor to `suppressions.xml`)?

PS: I have checked (using `git diff`) that my `checkstyle.xml` and `build.gradle` (that is, the version no. of Checkstyle I am using) is the same as AB3.

Just in case it's relevant:

* I'm running checkstyle using `./gradlew clean checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` inside IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.2.3.
* I'm on MacOS 26.0.1.

(Whether such constructors should/must have Javadoc header comments for the tP is discussed separately in #372.)

**6. :fas-info-circle: Should tP public constructors have Javadoc comments?**
</div>

Based on [the course's Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/index.html#comments), it appears that Javadoc header comments are required for all public constructors, as constructors are not one of the two exceptions listed (getters/setters and overriding methods in certain cases). 

Though arguably, for straightforward constructors, it might count as self-explanatory and thus not require Javadoc header comments under the [Google Java style guide exception for "self-explanatory members"](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7.3.1-javadoc-exception-self-explanatory) (I know the [textbook](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/cppToJava.html#:~:text=Constructors%20are%20not%20members) defines "members" to exclude constructors, but I'm not sure if Google is using the same definition. Even if it is, I guess one could argue that excluding Javadoc comments for straightforward constructors can follow the spirit of this rule, even if it doesn't follow the letter.)

Also, in the tP upstream repo (AB3),

* Some constructors, such as [the constructor for the `FindCommand.java` class](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/tp/blob/bd6718b2d6d7ca209ce08a9c33955687dfff97d9/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java#L23), do not have any Javadoc header comments.
* The [checkstyle.xml settings](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/tp/blob/bd6718b2d6d7ca209ce08a9c33955687dfff97d9/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml#L411) explicitly exclude checking for missing Javadoc header comments for constructors. (
    * I note that Checkstyle does not exclude _all_ constructors from this check, I'll create a separate forum post on this issue in the spirit of [the course's website instruction not to hijack other threads](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/appendixD-help.html#:~:text=Don't%20hijack%20other%20threads).

Should we add Javadoc header comments to (a) the public constructors we add to our tP repo and (b) existing public constructors from the upstream repo (if we do not change their implementation significantly)? Or is this a subjective thing which each team should make its own decision on, after weighing pros and cons?

In my opinion, for (a), there is low cost to doing so, and as such, it is probably a good idea still add Javadoc header comments as a good practice.

However, for (b), it feels like quite a substantial effort that I'm not sure is worth it. While adding such header comments can have some benefits (better understanding of the AB-3 code base + more practice writing Javadoc header comments), I think it is outweighed by the time spent doing so that could be better spent on other aspects of the tP aligned with more important learning objectives.

**7. :fas-info-circle: Using external libraries for iP without approval**

Do we need to request approval in this forum before using 3rd-party libraries for our iP?

I understand from the [course website on tP constraints](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-constraints.html#constraint-external-software) that we must seek approval prior to using any external software for the _tP_.

I'm thinking of using some external libraries to extend my iP to try out them to see if they may be appropriate for tP/other personal projects.

I'm aware that we must follow the relevant license rules when using 3rd-party libraries, and that, for legal reasons we are generally not permitted to use libraries that do not have any license (source: [GitHub's choosealicence.com page on "No License"](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/)).

### Problem

Under [Week 2 > "Project" > Step 3: "Set up the project on your computer"](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week2/project.html#3-set-up-the-project-on-your-computer) point 3, there is a warning informing students to avoid placing Git-controlled stuff inside cloud-synced folders.

Reason: Multiple tools trying to detect/sync changes in the same folder can cause conflicts and unexpected behaviors. If you want to access project files from multiple computers, use Git to do that (rather than cloud syncing tools)." />

However, as far as I could find, this warning is not included in the [Git Learning Trail for Week 1](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week1/topics.html#W1-6).

Students are expected to (and likely will) view the Git Learning Trail for Week 1 (and 2) and do its corresponding hands-on activities before setting up the project and seeing the above warning on cloud-synced folders. As such, during the trail's hand-on activities, students may end up making Git-controlled files in their cloud-synced folders, unaware of potential issues.

### Proposed solution

Include this warning in the Git Learning Trail for Week 1 before any hands-on activities. The same warning can be cross-embedded/repeated in the Week 2 iP set-up instructions just in case students forget.

This will ensure that students do not do the Git hands-on activities in the Git Learning Trail in a cloud-synced folders.

**10. :fas-info-circle: Policy on giving credit for IDE-generated code for constructors, getters/setters, etc.**
</div>



I understand from the [course website on the policy regarding reuse](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/appendixB-policies.html#giving-credit-for-reused-work) that we generally need to give credit for code reuse.

May I check if this also applies to straightforward code auto-generated by IDEs/other text editors, such as constructors, getters, setters, and toString() methods (for example, via the [IntellJ IDEA "Generate code" feature](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generating-code.html))? Do we need to give credit for such code and if so, how should we do so?

My impression is that, when first coding in Java, it is good to code such methods manually by hand to better understand them. But for those familiar with Java who have already manually typed out such methods many times, there seems to be little educational benefit to retype, say, a straightforward constructor or getter again. (Please correct me if I'm wrong! I recognise I'm not an expert on pedagogy.)

To be clear, I am not referring to code auto-generated by AI tools like Copilot. To the best of my knowledge, the aforementioned IDE/text editor features don't use what would typically be considered AI.

Not sure what the exact reason behind this is, but I note that Diablo's [`MainWindow#initialize()`](https://github.com/polyrhythmas/ip/blob/dbb7e4f656f9293f2c6de18cb9e42cb5b75234bb/src/main/java/diablo/ui/MainWindow.java#L37) method is slightly different from [the example in the course's JavaFX tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart4.html#refactor-duke-to-use-fxml). Maybe this is the reason why?

The [iP grading criteria](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/ip-grading.html#implementation-10-marks) requires the GUI to be "at least as good as the one reached by the JavaFx tutorial part 4," so perhaps you want want to look into this?

I encountered a similar issue. I did find a fix, but I want to check if it's okay.

### Solution found

The only solution I've tried that works _(I recommend attempting this on a new branch, **not** on `master`)_ is running `bundle update`.  

Afterwards, running `bundle install` and then `bundle exec jekyll serve` gives me an output similar to the one on the [GitHub Docs Jekyll tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#building-your-site-locally) and allows me to view the site on `localhost`.

However, I understand that executing `bundle update` results in an update to the version of all gems in `Gemfile.lock`.

@KieronOei Does this work for you?

@damithc May I check if we are allowed to update `Gemfile.lock` (and push the changes to our team's repo, given that our teammates are agreeable to it)?

### Other fixes tried

I tried the following fixes and they did not work:

- Uninstalling bundler and reinstalling version 2.1.4
    - For some reason, 2.7.2 is considered a "default" version that I cannot uninstall.
- Uninstalling and reinstalling Ruby
- Installing Ruby 3.1 using Homebrew
    - For some reason `chruby` doesn't detect Ruby 3.1.
- Installing Ruby 3.1 using `ruby-install`
   - Error message: `Compiling ruby 3.1.7 failed!`

(For reference, I am also using MacOS.)

According to [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/071h21gptcp0), there is an ongoing incident with GitHub Actions MacOS runners. This appears to confirm what [Prof Damith mentioned in his earlier comment](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/forum/issues/353#issuecomment-3355153628) that this is a temporary issue on GitHub's side.

There is a "Subscribe to Updates" button in the GitHub Status website link above if you want to get updates from GitHub when the issue is resolved.

Hope this helps!

TL;DR - Recommend making classes completely immutable, or else avoid using mutable fields in `equals(Object)` and `hashCode()`

Sorry, this is very long, because I ended up on a rabbit hole one day when I was searching how to best design tests for `equals(Object)` methods in Java.

> "Classes should be immutable unless there’s a very good reason to make them mutable."
> 
> \- Joshua Bloch's _Effective Java_ (3rd Ed.), p. 86

_Note: You can legally get the full eBook of_ Effective Java _from [NUS Libraries](https://go.exlibris.link/Z8nvcMVB) for free._

Immutability brings various advantages, such as:

* Simplifies issues regarding state.
* Can be shared between classes without worrying about [aliasing bugs](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AliasingBug.html).
* Thread-safe.
* Easy failure atomicity (which means that when a method is called and throws some exception, the objects should be in the same state as it was prior to the method call).

(Source for above points: Bloch's _Effective Java_, Items 17 and 76)

The main disadvantage of immutable classes are mainly memory and performance related (because you must construct a new class whenever modifying any field). However, I think most tP projects are small scale enough that this will not be an issue. Regardless, we should [avoid pre-mature optimization](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week5/topics.html#implementation-code-quality-readability-intermediate-avoid-premature-optimizations).

Immutability is especially important when using `equals(Object)` (and `hashCode()`).

Using mutable fields when comparing objects in `equals(Object)` or generating its hash code is discouraged due to the issues you mentioned. For a more detailed discussion, you can refer to [this article on writing equality methods in Java by Odersky et al.](https://www.artima.com/articles/how-to-write-an-equality-method-in-java) (under "Pitfall #&#8203;3").

&lt;!-- &#8203; is an invisible character, added to avoid addressing a GitHub issue. Credit to https://stackoverflow.com/a/52463489. -->

The [EqualsVerifier library](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier) designed for Java unit testing of `equals` and `hashCode` enforces that fields that `equals` depends on should be `final` (source: [EqualsVerifier manual page on immutability](https://jqno.nl/equalsverifier/manual/immutability/)), and in fact, even recommends you make the class itself or its `equals` method `final` (source: [EqualsVerifier manual page on "Making things final"](https://jqno.nl/equalsverifier/manual/final/)).

More generally, you should try to ensure that you follows the general contract for `Object#equals(Object)` and `Object#hashCode()`, which is detailed in the [Java API for java.lang.Object](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html). This can help avoid some hard-to-fix bugs using collections, especially hash-based ones. There's a more detailed discussion on how to ensure you fulfil this contract (and common pitfalls) in _Effective Java_ Items 10 and 11. EqualsVerifier can help check if your code follow this contract.

If you want an extended discussion on how to design a good `equals(Object)` method implementation, I recommend [this relevant video by Jan Ouwens](https://youtu.be/pNJ_O10XaoM), who's behind the EqualsVerifier library mentioned earlier. Bloch's _Effective Java_ is also a pretty good book in my opinion!

(Note: Base AB-3 does not strictly follow the Java `equals` and `hashCode` general contracts. I think in some cases, perhaps the costs of following the contract outweighs the benefits. For instance, it is highly unlikely anyone would put any of the `Parser` subclasses in a hash-based collection, so overriding `hashCode` for these subclasses is unnecessary even though `equals` is overridden.)

Thanks prof for the quick response!

In the context of tP, the [course website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-deliverables.html#deliverable-user-guide-ug) mentions:

> **In UG/DG, using hierarchical section numbering and figure numbering is optional** (reason: it's not easy to do in Markdown), but make sure it does not inconvenience the reader (e.g., use section/figure title and/or hyperlinks to point to the section/figure being referred to). Examples:
> 
> > In the section [Implementation](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-deliverables.html) given above ...

While use case numberings may not strictly count as "hierarchical section numbering" or "figure numbering," would similar reasoning also apply for use case numbering in the tP DG (and DGs made for other projects beyond this course also made with Markdown)?

For example, suppose a team were to number their use cases UC01 to, say, UC20 in their Markdown DG, and then Alice wants to add a new use case after UC02 (because the new use case is closely related to UC02 and thus it is easier for readers if it is put after UC02 rather than at the end). Would this not then be very troublesome for her to then re-number all of the original use cases UC03 to UC20?

Could a team use hyperlinks and/or non-numerical identifiers instead of numbering use cases for cross-referencing?

In the context of the final exam, in questions about UML use cases, would missing identifiers be considered an error?

For example, suppose there is an exam question showing a UML use case that does not include such an identifier, and the question asks how many mistakes are there in this use case. Would the lack of an identifier count as one such error?

Alright, thank you Prof for the fast and comprehensive response!

> Side note: UML doesn't specify a format for use cases. What we use in the course is a format commonly used, but there are other formats as well.

Oh I see, I think I misunderstood the textbook, because the [introduction section on use case](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/topics.html#requirements-specifying-requirements-use-cases-introduction), _The UML User Guide_ is cited, and in [a later section on usage of use cases](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/topics.html#requirements-specifying-requirements-use-cases-usage), the textbook writes, "UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case." which seems to imply UML has some requirements about the text contents of a use, albeit not specific ones.

Am I correct to say that regarding use cases, UML only specifies format for use case _diagrams_ but not for _textual descriptions_ of use cases?

If an exception is thrown, I suspect there might be a more serious bug behind it. Perhaps this is beyond the effort expected for PE, but since you have the stacktrace, maybe you can review the repo code and try to find the bug yourself. Alternatively, you can try testing further to see if, say, there has been some corruption to the data.

Even if you find some bigger issue(s) behind it, you can still file this terminal output bug as a separate report, since the website says there's no penalty for duplicate reports.

> So, it is safe to assume that 100's of lines that was thrown due to 1 exception could 'worry' the user despite the UI operating normally?

In my opinion, this is reasonable. I cannot speak on behalf of my teammates or my team as a whole, but personally if I got a bug report about this for PE, I would likely accept it. 

The only case where I think this might not be a bug is if the developers mention somewhere (such as in a separate line of terminal output or in the UG) that this error output can be safely ignored. 

> If so, would it be appropriate to label it as
>
> * Functionality bug

Sounds fine. Alternatively, if you think the best way to fix this problem is to inform users in the UG that such terminal output can be safely ignored, then it's likely `type.DocumentationBug`.  (Though I can't really think of a scenario this is the best option.)

> * Severy.low (because it doesn't impact the user)

I'm admittedly not really sure about this. I think it might be `severity.VeryLow` since it's arguably cosmetic.

On the other hand, some other factors might perhaps make it higher severity:

* Is such output common? For example, is this exception thrown everytime a commonly used command is run?
* Upon seeing this output, is a reasonable user likely to...
  * ...think her previous command(s) was (were) unsuccessful?
  * ...take some action to attempt to rectify the (perceived) error? If so, what is the effect of such actions?
* Might the message alarm an average user enough to decide not to continue using the product?
* How is the target audience specifically likely to interpret this command? How much technical knowledge about stacktraces are they likely/assumed to have? How might this affect their level of alarm or the actions they take in response to the output?

Section of [course website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-pe.html#documentation-bugs-2) that might be relevant:

> **Details in the diagram too small:** This is usually a symptom of having too much info in the diagram. ...
While the reader can zoom to see smaller details, this can still be considered a cosmetic issue (i.e., `severity.VeryLow`).

For determining if this is actually a bug, I would consider:

* * How important are the seemingly lower-level/optional components (such as the methods and their visibility) of this diagram? Is there anything specific about this app that may justify including these components? 
* If these components are important, could the developers have broken up the diagram, as [advised by the course websit](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-deliverables.html#:~:text=Break%20diagrams%20into%20smaller%20fragments%20when%20possible.)?

For severity, personally I would consider the following factors:

* How important is this diagram to developers? If you were, say, a new developer coming to this app, how much would this diagram hinder your ability to understand the existing code base and make changes?
* This diagram appears to be for a specific feature. How important is this feature for developers?

I think severity might depend on some additional factors:

* How likely is the user to use this feature?
* What is the potential impact of the user following the incorrect command format? For example, might it result in data loss? If so, how much data is lost and is this data loss permanent?
* Does the app provide some help feature or an error message that may help the user rectify the inaccuracy in the UG?
* How likely is it for a member of the target audience be able to infer that the command format is incorrect? (For example, is it an obvious typo?)

You might also want to reference Q10 of the PE Readiness Quiz (screenshot below):

<img width="796" height="577" alt="Screenshot of a Canvas quiz. The question asks for the most suitable severity of a bug in the UG, where in the commands supposed to list all contacts in descending and ascending order of their name, 'down' is misspelt.

The user can continue to use the application.'" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fd6d708-58b6-470a-a4f1-774d3db43196" />

oh no, I have already created an upstream remote but merge it without -no-ff, and I close my origin intellij project, now I cannot edit the file but gradle features are still in my directory. It's totally a mess, what should I do? Shall I delete all the gradle related folders and restart? Or shall I revert to previous commit? I regret it, I shouldn't have done that before your reply.

I clone the fork, and the branch is on the remote. Do I need to fetch branch-Level-7 and branch-Level-8? And, do I need to remove all the gradle related file before I fetch the gradle branch? Last but not least, I tried to click the java file but it still cannot open in Intellij.  Should I open in a new project?

Thank you, now gradlew clean test can run. Further questions to verify: now I can't push origin to master (I reset the commit, and merge with no ff), to successfully push it, should I create new commits? And, given that the A-Gradle Tag I pushed is wrong, should I delete the tag, and tag it & push it again?

gradlew clean test can pass without the test file, but fails when the test file exists. And I still cannot compile because the java compiler says the import statement of org.junit.jupiter.api is wrong (does not exist). But you can run the test file on your laptop?

current update: both gradlew clean test & ./gradlew run can run without test files

In fact, I just put assertEquals(2, 2) but failed the test case. It is because the test file won't compile and it cannot find the package org.junit.jupiter.api

I've encountered this issue too (which arises due to the Markdown processor that GitHub Pages uses); you can try the fix [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/244#issuecomment-2669347989).

For GFM, is it that I create a _config.yml file in the root directory that has the line "markdown: GFM"? Should the file contain any other contents? And, should I commit the file?

```
 Common mistake: Doing the proposed changes in the master branch -- if Jean does that, she will not be able to have more than one PR open at any time because any changes to the master branch will be reflected in all open PRs.
```

I don't really understand why making changes on the master branch (of your own fork of a team repo), and then making a PR from that master branch (of your forked repo) to the master branch of the team repo is not recommended. 

Even though they are two branches from different repos, when I push my forked repo's master branch to the team repo (to create a PR into the team repo's master branch), will it show up as a change to the team repo's master branch?

**4. :fas-info-circle: Error when using VSCode: [filename].java is a non-project file, only syntax errors are reported**
</div>

I'm using VSCode for the iP. However, I don't see any real-time error highlighting (eg. missing imports, usage of undeclared methods, etc).

When I navigate to the problems tab, this is what I see:

<img width="1111" height="371" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a6dc028-3a7a-4c09-bd34-f3b070bab1e3" />

It says "[class name].java is a non-project file, only syntax errors are reported"

 My folder structure is correct (all the .java files are in src/main/java/...):

I have also tried right clicking on the src folder and selecting "Add Folder To Java Source Path" as suggested on StackOverflow, but this does not solve the problem. In fact, it gives rise to some errors:

Thanks for the suggestion, but it seems like VSCode isn't recognising this as a Java project :(

I clicked reload, as well as tried Clean Java Language Server Workspace. But it doesn't fix the issue.

> Hi, I tested your cody.jar on my Mac. It doesn’t start up properly — I get an error: “Unknown task type being read from file” and then a NullPointerException because this.cody is null. Looks like the program is trying to load some data or config before launching, but it fails and leaves cody uninitialized. Maybe a missing/corrupted data file?

That's really strange. It works on Windows and Linux.

It looks like when a new .txt file is created on Mac, it might be putting some unexpected lines into it, instead of creating a blank .txt file.

Could I ask for your help in testing this please? I inserted a more descriptive statement in the exception to figure out what is the corrupted line that it's trying to read: https://github.com/adityagk753/ip/releases/tag/Debugging-Mac-OS

This should work now. I think MacOS was causing issues because it interpreted existing text in the .txt file differently. 

Please try running it and executing the command `todo task1`.

Please let me know if it works now🙏

(I'm asking CS2101 side too)
 
Can the user guides for both be slightly different if we want? I think of it as having a technical and a beginner-friendly/non-technical version. (Or could a compromise be ignoring everything in the Known Issues section of our UserGuide in CS2101 and us putting all our necessary technical info there?)
 
It is expedient for CS2103T to have technical details to address potential bug reports. (While for CS2101 I imagine it is not favourable.)
 
I believe students from previous iterations of the 2101-2103T courses have mentioned feeling conflicted about the different requirements for 2101 and 2103T.

## Purpose

So sorry for the trouble (we might not use FlexMark, the last library, due to size after all but), could I use Google Guava? I've checked that it's only 2.91MB. I'm fixing bugs about implementing pairing between two Persons, and because Person is immutable, we'll need ids too. 

uSAGE:`BiMap&lt;Person, Integer> ids`
`SetMultimap&lt;Integer, Integer> links`

(Otherwise, I'd make `Map&lt;Person, Integer>` and `Map&lt;Integer, Person>`, and make sure both are up-to-date/no errors. And use a `Map&lt;Integer, Set&lt;Integer> >`)

**9. :fas-info-circle: Will we be penalised for using enums instead of subclassing Task?**
</div>

Will we be penalised for using enums instead of subclassing Task?

In [week 2](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week2/project.html#4-add-increments-while-committing-frequently-level-0-level-1-level-2-level-3-level-4-a-textuitesting-level-5-level-6-a-enums-fri-aug-22nd-1600), A-Inheritance was only said to be "recommended", and not in the list of compulsory Additions. I took the optional A-Enums as encouragement to do
```
enum TaskType ``{``
    T, D, E
``}``
```
instead.

In [week 3's A-MoreOOP](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/project.html#4-add-increments-a-moreoop-a-packages-a-gradle-a-junit-a-jar), it was said:

> Minimal: Extract the following classes:
> - Ui: deals with interactions with the user
> - Storage: deals with loading tasks from the file and saving tasks in the file
> - Parser: deals with making sense of the user command
> - TaskList: contains the task list e.g., it has operations to add/delete tasks in the list

I only realised late in week 6 that subclassing Task was given as an example ("e.g." not "i.e."). (I do have other inheritances (`Main extends Application, DialogBox extends HBox`), and I daresay my "code [is overall] divided into classes in a sensible way")

> Reasonable use of OOP e.g., at least some use of inheritance, code divided into classes in a sensible way (e.g., Ui, Storage, Parser, Todo, Deadline, Event etc.)


~~I now see that subclasses is the slightly better approach if more Task types are added, but I guess splitting into subclasses can add overhead in a small project, ending up with more files, more boilerplate, and more places to update when requirements change. Keeping everything in one Task with a TaskType enum is simpler to maintain early on, avoids class sprawl, and makes storage/serialization more straightforward.~~

(I promise to take this lesson of OOP to my TP, and use the extra time to revise CS2103 theory for exams if I don't have to refactor my code.)

**11. :fas-info-circle: Failing official automated smoke test despite passing teammates smoke tests**
</div>

<img width="772" height="636" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69901809-e49e-4200-b105-fc3cb8b6cf69" />


Did anyone else get this despite passing smoke tests on your friends' different OS's? It almost seems like the error msg is saying GUI forwarding didn't work, and not something wrong with my jar file, or am i high?

Is my 9.618mb = 9.2MiB jar file ([link](https://github.com/c-j-lh/ip/releases/download/A-Release/ramarama.jar)) suspiciously small? All our systems alr have javafx, and that's the only testing weakness i can think of, but `jar tf ramarama.jar | grep -E '&hat;javafx/|&hat;com/sun/javafx/|&hat;org/openjfx'`
 seems to show javafx is correctly bundled in my jar

I have tagged this HelpRequest cos I feel like my teammates have alr smoke-tested it (on Mac and Windows), but any additional smoke-tests are welcome.

Thanks a lot, I have just changed my build.gradle to the following, to have the mac and linux implementations of javafx. Now it works on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), whereas it previously didn't, so I hope it will now pass the Linux automated test which was the one it failed.  (I suppose it passed the Mac ones by luck/quirk even though I didn't have the mac implementation of javafx).

I'll post a smoke test request for Linux and Mac, but) let me know if there any other check it might be wise to do. I will close this thread soon after i guess

@damithc Thanks. I'll take it that we **must** subclass Task(?)    (despite it being "e.g." and not "i.e.")

**1. :fas-info-circle: Should equals() and hashCode() only include immutable fields, or should I make everything immutable?**
</div>

After editing **AB3**, we introduced an `Events` class that stores a `HashSet&lt;Member>`.  
Each `Member` object also stores its own `eventRoles` — so there are multiple references between `Event` and `Member`.

Because of this two-way relationship, we decided to make these objects **mutable**.  
However, we soon realised that editing a `Member` (for example, adding an event role) would change its state, which in turn **changes its `hashCode()`**.  This caused confusing bugs — like members disappearing from `HashSet`s or duplicate entries appearing after updates.

---

## 🧠 The two designs I’m considering

1. **Immutable identity-based equality**  
   - Only include *immutable fields* (like `name`, `phone`, `email`) in `equals()` and `hashCode()`.  
   - Mutable fields (like `eventRoles`) are excluded to avoid breaking collections.

2. **Fully immutable objects**  
   - Make both `Member` and `Event` immutable.  
   - Replace objects entirely instead of mutating them when changes happen.

---

## ❓ My question

Which approach is generally more robust or better?

- Is it fine to define equality only on immutable “identity” fields, even if two objects that differ in mutable fields will still be considered equal?  
- Or is it better practice to go all-in on immutability to avoid inconsistencies entirely?

Would really appreciate any design insights or best-practice advice

Is writing a try with just finally okay, the code I am reviewing does that since it propagates errors to the function caller
From the java coding standard:
A try-catch statement should have the following form:

I think one reason could be because the concept is mainly conceptual compared to composition which is practical and enforceable -- what i mean by conceptual is when we say the part **can** exist independently from the whole, it makes it unclear how we should deal with the part and if it really exists independently eg. Library aggregates book - can book exist independently from library? maybe yes, but what does the diagram intend for us to do with that information? The diagram does not specify what that means for ownership or lifecycle, so in this sense it does not really add much value. I think using association or composition to clarify relationships can be clearer

For the cases where the parent documentation does not fully represent what your function does, you can also use `@inheritDoc` to also include the parent class documentation in your overriden method documentation, and add on details on top of it

'''java
/**
 * ``{``@inheritDoc``}``
 * &lt;p>
 * Besides that, ....
 * &lt;/p>
 */

For checking code convention violations, I tried to copy paste the violations list into ChatGPT and then pasting my code to see if it can discover any violations, but unfortunately it was not very helpful for that - example it kept saying certain lines are too long but it is just because the copy paste does not copy the line breaks properly.
On the other hand, for code quality issues, I tried discussing with it to help me brainstorm ideas for how to fix my code quality issues. For example I had this long code in my getResponse() method and asked how should I split it into classes or into methods etc. and it was helpful to think through how I could refactor my code with it

The reason Inbox and Message don’t have a Composition relationship is likely because messages can exist independently of a particular inbox. A Message might belong to multiple inboxes (e.g., the sender’s sent box and the receiver’s inbox).

**4. :fas-info-circle: Workaround for CSS syntax highlight for IntelliJ CE**
</div>

I was trying to get CSS syntax highlight for IntelliJ ***CE*** (note its not the professional version)

The official document clearly says only the professional version has the CSS plugin available.

But I found a discussion on SO that says 

>You can get CSS syntax highlighting in IntelliJ Community Edition via [TextMate Bundles](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7221-textmate-bundles) plugin. The plugin is built-in in modern versions of IDEA and has built-in CSS bundle but to make it work you have to remove CSS from Recognized File Types:
    - Go to Settings > Editor > File Types > CSS (syntax highlighting only)
    - Remove *.css from File name patterns

But I am not sure if there is potentially bad side effect of "remove CSS from Recognized File Types"

This is the link to the SO question [no-css-highlighting-and-completion-in-intellij](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24935964/no-css-highlighting-and-completion-in-intellij) and the "workaround" is provided by [Ilya Rodionov](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9137155/ilya-rodionov).

I think beside exact matching, you can add feature like:

but just in situation that the additional workload is acceptable to you.

the solution:

3. push to remote: `git push`

I think this is not a problem about coding standard but about usage.
In cases where:

1. Programmer intend to propagate exceptions upward **only after** the finally block is called to clean up AND
2. The function at current level cannot handle the exception

In this case, *a try with just finally* is appropriate and not violate code standard.

So it depends on how your reviewee use it.

---
An example to illustrate point 1:
'''java
public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
    try ``{``
        System.out.println("In try");
        int x = 5 / 0;   // ArithmeticException
    ``}`` finally ``{``
        System.out.println("In finally");
    ``}``
    System.out.println("After try-finally");
``}``
'''
will print
'''
In try
In finally   &lt;-- here the finally block is executed first before the exception handled
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
'''

Also some good resource to look at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2614473/does-it-make-sense-to-do-try-finally-without-catch

Hi prof I am seeking help from experienced IDE user to prevent me from breaking the IDE since "remove CSS from Recognized File Types" sounds dangerous to me.

It also can be consider as sharing a tip. I tried it out and so far nothing serious happen and it did give some syntax highlight, comparing to completely no highlight.

Since you can run with `./gradlew run`, your build.gradlew and JavaFX should be all set. Now Gradle knows where to find JavaFX (via dependencies in build.gradle) to do the `run` task

But your IntelliJ’s Application run config does not know, unless you tell it. But all the setting from your screenshot looks good, and I cannot reproduce the error with your setting.

My suggestion is just use `./gradlew run`

Another possibility is your JavaFX plugin has been disabled.

else you could consider passing in input and storing the string and comparing it to the output string by using a testfile.txt (similar logic to storage or the ui-testing we did earlier in the prev week) (please ask me if you are unclear or i didnt explain well enough!)

yepp pls change your application! change it to the name of your main application which i believe is David (but seems like you have it under a folder / package) so format it accordingly 

also before testing david maybe check some dummy stuff like assertEquals(2,2) to test if everything is okay, let me know if that works for you first

hmm maybe could you try run this part of the code in your testing file
package seedu.duke;  //same package as the class being tested

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class DukeTest ``{``
    @Test
    public void dummyTest()``{``
        assertEquals(2, 2);
    ``}``

    @Test
    public void anotherDummyTest()``{``
        assertEquals(4, 4);
    ``}``
``}``

maybe double check your steps w 
https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html
https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html

also what branch are you on? and have you fetched the add-gradle-support branch from the upstream repo?

git remote add upstream https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/ip.git
git remote -v
You should now see both origin and upstream. (which you do)
git fetch upstream
Now you should see upstream/add-gradle-support when you run: (which you do)
git branch -a
create a local branch that tracks it:
git switch -c add-gradle-support upstream/add-gradle-support
This means:

-c → create new local branch

name it add-gradle-support

base it on upstream/add-gradle-support

Now you’re “on” that branch.
Merge into master

Switch back to master:

git switch master


Merge the Gradle support branch into master:

git merge --no-ff add-gradle-support -m "Merge add-gradle-support into master"


At this point, your master branch has Gradle support.
Push both branches to your fork:

git push origin master
git push origin add-gradle-support
Now that Gradle support is merged, you should see new files in your repo:

build.gradle

settings.gradle

gradlew and gradlew.bat

gradle/ folder

From here:

Run your program with Gradle:

./gradlew run


(this were the steps i followed for my case)

Does the app launch correctly? i.e. no path error, can input text (e.g. HelLo or hI, case not matter) in text field and send by clicking button, then use list and see if the bot give an empty list.  yep all tested, works correctly
Use bye to exit, then launch again, use command list and see if task(s) stored previously is loaded correctly. yes, stores tasks
tested edge cases too all looks good!

E.g. I reported a bug that is high severity. This bug was flagged as a duplicate by the team. The original bug was also high severity and the team responded to the original bug that bug should be of medium severity.

Taking a look at other repositories, it is confirmed that it is not an issue with the `gradle.yml` file here, as other groups have managed to get it to work without any changes between their files and yours. Likewise, looking at the screenshot, you seem to have also followed steps 1 to 3 of the tutorial correctly.

Viewing the codecov [page](https://app.codecov.io/gh/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T09-2) for your repository appears to have it work for `tp1` but not `tp`. Other than that, my second guess for the issue would be other permission issues in your repository settings, do you remember making any major changes in such between `tp` and `tp1`? Thanks.

My team received an issue where my UG specifically was missing value proposition but the value proposition was written to the DG. How do i deal with such an issue since DG explicitly states the points. Is it a requirement for this to be present in both documents.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Bug found through external factors, outside of applications control**
</div>

One can go to the data file and restrict it to Read Only or launch the application through java (Not mentioned in course) with limited write, different from the general documented launching of the file. This would cause the application to (1) not write to the data file due to limited permissions and (2) maintain shadow entries of the contact information, but it still fails gracefully with an error message for every data modification command / the data file cannot be modified. This particular bug applies to all AB3 related applications (and in-general any application where user modifies file write permissions).

The question is : is such a bug in scope or should they be rejected

Not write to data file:

Maintain a shadow entry on which default commands still work (like edit, delete etc) but not written to file.

Consider using [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github-in-github-desktop) which will help manage credentials and all the different actions used in the course. 

Why is github desktop is your choice (Chatgpt to help):

* **GitHub Desktop handles login for you.**
  When you sign in through the app, it opens a web-based OAuth flow (your browser), then securely stores a token locally. This means you don’t need to deal with `git config credential.helper`, `ssh keys`, or `gh auth login` manually.

* **Behind the scenes:**
  GitHub Desktop still uses Git under the hood. Normally on the CLI you’d need to:

  * Set up **SSH keys** or
  * Configure a **personal access token (PAT)** for HTTPS.

  Desktop does this transparently by using the stored OAuth token whenever Git needs authentication.

* **Where it helps:**

  * No repeated username/password prompts.
  * No need to copy PATs or manage SSH keys manually.
  * Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) so it bypasses common OS credential manager headaches.

* **Where it doesn’t fully solve things:**

  * If you switch to command line Git outside of GitHub Desktop, you’ll still need to configure authentication (PAT/SSH) separately.
  * If you need advanced Git features (custom credential helpers, enterprise setups, automation), you’ll still have to touch the CLI.

👉 So: GitHub Desktop **solves authentication for itself** and makes Git "just work" in the GUI. But if you jump back into terminal Git, the Desktop login won’t automatically cover you unless your OS credential manager has synced with it.

As @nty-dev has mentioned, personal access tokens can only be used for HTTPS Git operations. If your repository uses an SSH remote URL, you will need to [switch the remote from SSH to HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/managing-remote-repositories#switching-remote-urls-from-ssh-to-https).

Also based on your operating system you could try the follow fix (Generated with chatgpt and the prompt below) :
'''prompt
Hi I tried following the instructions in https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html and https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic. I entered the username and PAT and received the message of "Authentication failed". I created a new PAT, reentered the username and new PAT and still received the message of "Authentication failed".
'''

## 🔹 Windows (SourceTree + GitHub PAT)

### Step 1: Clear old GitHub credentials

1. Open **Control Panel → Credential Manager**.
2. Go to **Windows Credentials**.
3. Find entries related to `github.com` (under *Generic Credentials*).
4. Remove them.

---

### Step 2: Make sure you’re using System Git

1. Open **SourceTree → Tools → Options → Git tab**.
2. Select **Use System Git** (not Embedded Git).
3. Apply and restart SourceTree.

---

### Step 3: Re-add GitHub account with PAT

1. In SourceTree, go to **Tools → Options → Authentication**.
2. Remove any old GitHub accounts.
3. Click **Add** → Choose *GitHub* → Choose *HTTPS*.
4. When prompted for username/password:

   * **Username** → your GitHub username (not email).
   * **Password** → your PAT.

If SourceTree rejects it, you can instead let Windows Credential Manager store it:

'''bash
git credential-manager-core erase
git credential-manager-core store
'''

and then retry push/pull once in SourceTree.

---

## 🔹 Mac (SourceTree + GitHub PAT)

### Step 1: Clear old GitHub credentials

1. Open **Keychain Access**.
2. Search for `github.com`.
3. Delete any entries.

---

### Step 2: Switch Git in SourceTree

1. Open **SourceTree → Preferences → Git**.
2. Select **System Git**.
3. Restart SourceTree.

---

### Step 3: Re-add GitHub account with PAT

1. Go to **SourceTree → Preferences → Accounts**.
2. Remove any old GitHub entries.
3. Add a new one:

   * Hosting Service: **GitHub**
   * Protocol: **HTTPS**
   * Authentication: **Basic**
   * Username: your GitHub username
   * Password: your **PAT**

If SourceTree refuses to accept the PAT in GUI, you can set it via terminal:

'''bash
git credential-osxkeychain erase
git credential-osxkeychain store
'''

and then retry push/pull in SourceTree.

---

## 🔹 Quick sanity check (works on both)

Before retrying SourceTree, confirm your PAT works in terminal:

'''bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/username/repo.git
'''

* Enter username → GitHub username
* Enter password → PAT

If that succeeds, SourceTree should also succeed once credentials are cleared and reset.

The issue is that modifying file write permissions lies beyond the control of any standard application unless it operates with administrative (root) privileges. I’d like to keep this thread open for further discussion, as I’m interested in understanding how one could prevent system-level modifications given AB3’s current permission model and constraints.

> Although, one can question if the user knows that his working directory does not have file write permissions, should he attempt to use a contact **storing** application? I do think its analogous to how a customer might argue that a comb is not suited for bald heads. Technically true, but practically it is no concern

This is a really hilarious analogy and I agree, I had a good laugh. To fix such a problem, the best solution I can think of is that the address book will need root level permissions so the file it writes to always has read and write permissions. I doubt anyone would want to give their book keeping application admin level privileges but I suppose to fix such a problem this is a method. Is it a good solution? Definitely Not. But are there other ways to prevent such a bug, I dont think so.

I learned a new area of PE testing today. To summarise for other thread readers, the bugs are (from what I have gathered through the current string of messages), best classified as `NotInScope`. Since they are technically bugs that users might face, and the application should help the user to the fullest, even a documentation suggestion could help the user debug. 

An honourable mention to a suggested fix from my teammate: Give the user the ability to pick the data directory. Debugging such an issue become much easier with a proper pipeline in-place. Although manually changing application permissions could resurface the issue, it is more transparent to the user. 

Ill keep the thread open for a while longer as I am learning quite a few new testing ideologies, feel free to share some other external factors experienced, if I find more I will add them as my last message and close this thread.

This issue broadened my classification of what is a bug drastically. I took a look at some similar issues and realized that actually, some of the bugs or known issues mentioned for examplify (Yes our exam software) can literally be copy pasted into the PE bugs , with some modification, as these are also some known issues applications have to work with. That made me realize that not documenting how to delete your application can also be considered a bug. Its funny that if we set our antivirus to disable jar files from launching, this can become a bug too, since the application should be able to launch based on instructions. Quite a grey area in my opinion and `NotInScope` looks like the method to save teams who missed out on these.

I think its very subjective and depends on the type of project, certain brownfields could be a simple feature addition and it fulfils the customers or stakeholders needs. So as such there is no true answer, it solely depends on your starting and ending point.

@damithc just to clear up, if the differences are purely for cosmetic / user experience purposes such as moving links, removing sidebar and replacing with a table (for PDFs) etc, then wouldn't they be encouraged?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Adding Gradle to the project but options for step 3 not appearing**
</div>

HI, I am following this https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html#:~:text=click%20it.-,Scenario%202,-%3A%20You%20are to add Gradle to the project.

For step 3:
Confirm the correct Java version is being used for Gradle, as follows:
(a) Confirm the project JDK is set to the one you are supposed to use for the project, as explained [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).
(b) Confirm the correct JVM is used for Gradle, as given in the panel below:

However, I only see general settings and not the Gradle Projects on my side.

> [@learningcoding-pixel](https://github.com/learningcoding-pixel) There is a chance that the `gitmastery` command is hitting a different file than the intended `gitmastery.exe`. I suggest the following:
> 
> 1. Delete any files that has `gitmastery` in your `Downloads` folder.
> 2. Remove `Downloads` from the `PATH`. It is not a good idea to put in the `PATH` as that is a location where all sorts of files will arrive from the Internet.
> 3. Restart git-bash. Run `gitmastery --help` to ensure it can't find the file to run (i.e., gitmastery is no longer in the `PATH`)
> 4. Download `gitmastery.exe` again. Ensure it has the `.exe` extension.
> 5. Move it to some other location e.g., `/c/Users/yinwe/Apps`. Add that folder to the `PATH`.
> 6. Restart `git-bash` and try again

OK I followed the instructions.
I copy and paste the following code into Gitbash.

gitmastery --help
cd ../my-projects # cd into a different folder
gitmastery --help

and I got the output of

Ok I ran the command and the Github Sign in window pop up. I closed the window and I entered the username and PAT in the subsequent popups.

I ran the command again and the Github Sign in window still pops up. I think the setup process is still not completed.

I updated the passwords in the credential manager for the 2 github related credentials I could find under windows credentials. 
There were no github related credentials in the web credentials.

Then in gitbash, when I entered the input:

 $ git push origin Level-0

I received the pop up window of connect to Github.

Just to be sure the PAT for the source tree is not the same as the PAT used for the previous github authentication in T2L2. Preparing to use GitHub?

Hi jvvvstin, I see gradle on the right side of the window.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Guidance on responding to severity downgrade**
</div>

I have reported two types of bugs to a team (which they argue should be downgraded) and need guidance on what the severity should be like. I have both reported them as medium/high earlier.

1. Application does not gracefully handle typical invalid input

On some commands, I reported that there are cases where when an invalid input is provided (not an extreme case, e.g. just a typo), the UI doesn't respond at all due to the system not gracefully handling internal errors. I have no feedback from a user perspective, and have to check either the terminal output filled with Java errors or the user guide to see what's wrong (though, checking the user guide doesn't tell me specifically what might be wrong with my command). 

The team argues that this invalid case is rare edge case behaviour, and only causes minor inconvenience as the user would naturally investigate themselves on what's wrong through other available commands. Indeed, other commands can provide some clarity on the valid/invalid inputs. I somewhat see their perspective, as I did naturally investigate myself as to what went wrong given the UI response failure. But I don't know if this makes sense for it to be downgraded to a severity.Low, especially that this is a bug involving an uncaught error and the lack of a UI response completely. As a developer, I would find this issue critical, especially for a simple error like a typo in the command, but at the same time I somewhat see their point of this technically being recoverable as well.

2. Application does not start with correct sample data

The application restricts contacts to have certain non-empty attributes upon creation, but the sample data it starts with breaks this rule pretty glaringly (every contact generated breaks the rule). IMO, this is at least a medium as it causes immediate confusion for pretty much everyone starting up the app for the very first time. However, the team does argue that the UG makes this restriction clear throughout. This does allow users to continue to use the application, but the sample data remains erroneous until they are eventualy deleted. Is this a major inconvenience? What does the teaching team think this should be rated as?

In general, the common confusion I have with rating bugs w.r.t. to their severity is the 'inconvenience' caused. Are bugs that are 'severe' at point of discovery (very confusing / misleading at first) but are technically recoverable s.t. users can technically keep using their application w/ valid inputs considered 'severe'? If not, I assume it would depend on how easily the user can also continue to use the application (can make logical leaps as to what's wrong)? If so, as long as they follow the UG to a tee, would it then be considered as a low/medium rather than a medium/high?

Only removing this portion from ```docs/gemfile.lock``` fixes the issues and starts installing the packages:
```
BUNDLED WITH
   2.1.4
```
This feels dangerous to do. Is there a way to avoid this?
Uninstalling the newer version of bundle and only installing 2.1.4 causes a similar error.

Changing the line to:
```
BUNDLED WITH
   2.7.2
```
starts installing the packages, but causes even more issues. Namely, it currently stalls at installing Nokogiri. Either way, this doesn't feel like the correct solution to the problem(?).

**6. :fas-info-circle: Attempting to fix scrollbar not listening to mouse scroll before dragging the scroll bar**
</div>

For the most part, my scrollbar implemented through JavaFX works fine. Clicking the scrollbar and dragging it once it appears correctly traverses the scrollpane. After the first drag, scrolling using my mouse scroll wheel also works fine. 

However, this mouse scroll wheel behaviour does not work before I first click and drag the scrollbar in the UI. Is there a property that controls this, so that scrolling with the mouse wheel works without any prior click? I was unable to find the relevant part in the JavaFX documentation. I have not changed it from the SE-EDU tutorial.

Have put them both in my initialize() function in MainWindow.java, still does not work. No worries if this is an inherent issue with JavaFX that exist by default on other machines, just wondering if this is a solvable issue in the first place. It feels like an issue I need to solve given the focus of the app is it being CLI-based, and having to move the mouse and precisely click the thin scrollbar feel like it detracts from the CLI experience.

For clarification, I discovered that I did modify the original MainWindow.fxml, but only in the prefWidth and prefHeight properties. I have tried to reverse these changes, but the issue as described above still persists.

Solved it. The issue was in this line in intialize(): ''' scrollPane.vvalueProperty().bind(dialogContainer.heightProperty()); '''
This can be replaced with this code
'''
 dialogContainer.heightProperty().addListener((obs, oldVal, newVal) -&gt; ``{``
        scrollPane.setVvalue(1.0);
    ``}``);
'''
This should keep the behaviour of automatically setting it to the bottom when new content is added, but fixes the scrollbar not responding to mouse scroll until the first drag.

* By default, the Reminders pop-up covers the bot image on startup. If it's trivial to fix this, I'd recommend doing so as to not confuse the user.

* `event thing /from 2022-10-03 /to 2023-10-33` and `event thing /from 2022-10-03 /to 2023-10-33` causes a near-fatal error? The input doesn't clear, and subsequent valid commands just don't fully work either. Seems like the error isn't handled based on IntelliJ output?

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💎 [Sharing a new concept + discussion] Reflection vs Factory Pattern**
</div>

Hello! As we've been progressing with the tP, I've chanced upon an interesting Java concept not taught here nor 2030S that I thought can be useful:

[Java Reflection](https://www.baeldung.com/java-reflection#bd-Constructors)

### Context
For context, during development we have a code snippet that can be SLAP-ed harder but it also has a dependency on our Predicate subclasses. We can abstract these repeated codes to a form like this:

```
<T> Predicate<T> producePredicate(Class<? extends Predicate> predicateClassMetadata, Integer satelliteData) ``{``
    validate();
    compute();
    Constructor<?> constructor =  predicateClassMetadata.getConstructor(Integer.class);
    Predicate<T> instance = constructor.newInstance(satelliteData);
``}``

```
### Personal Thoughts
At first glance this seems pretty powerful, I instantly drew links to the factory pattern & LoD.

Pros: 
- In comparison to the factory pattern, it seems like we don't need class overhead and we can just express production via 1 method and proper usage of generics.
- This enables late binding so it seems friendly for plugin type use cases.

Cons:
- Law of Demeter is SEVERELY violated. With the metadata, we can inspect/use a stranger's data/functionality as and when.
- Defensive programming overhead is required because of dynamic typing, with that comes performance tradeoffs.

### Discussion questions

1. What concrete use cases/situations would it be appropriate to use this double-edged feature of Java?
3. How would UML diagrams such as class diagrams (static) and an object diagram (dynamic) affected if this is used?

Hey grace thought maybe I could provide my own differing perspective to your questions.

1. For my project, I did not follow @Gareth2YuSheng and instead opted to use Java's own library of exceptions like this:

```   
public String execute(TaskList taskList) throws IllegalArgumentException,
            NullPointerException, DateTimeParseException ``{``
    ...
``}``
```

The rationale behind this design was because I felt that there wasn't a need to make custom exceptions as existing exceptions are descriptive enough to cover the kinds of exceptions I am checking for. It should be noted as well that this decision has its pros and cons as well: 

- Pros: Reduced overhead of exception classes being created & familiarity with the thrown exceptions. 
- Cons: Potential ambiguity in semantics (It can be managed somewhat if documentations specify when these kinds of exceptions are thrown, see below)
    - If you were to use custom exceptions, it would directly map to your program's business logic, completely eliminating ambiguity.

```
/**
 * Creates a new Task object based on the user's request.
 * @param taskList The task list to add the new task to.
 * @return A new Task object of the specified type.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the task type is not recognized.
 * @throws NullPointerException If any of the required fields are missing.
 * @throws DateTimeParseException If the date format is incorrect.
 */
 @Override
 public String execute(TaskList taskList) throws IllegalArgumentException,
          NullPointerException, DateTimeParseException 
```


2. @Gareth2YuSheng and @chuckyang123 worded it nicely as well. I would like to add on that in more complex systems, exceptions can also take this form which is more elegant than if you were to just use plain if-else statements

```
try ``{``
    ...
``}`` catch (UnknownCommandException e) ``{``
    ui.showMessage("Error:" + e.getMessage())
``}`` catch (ProcessingException e) ``{``
     ui.showMessage("Error:" + e.getMessage())
    ... // Extra clean up logic
``}``
```

3. For me I think you won't be penalised as you met the minimal requirements. I do think its fine to mix exceptions and if-else statements as well. Though to elaborate on what the website says on **_when_** to use exceptions versus if-else statements, I would use exceptions when:

- I know this "case" of inputted data will disrupt crash my program or produce a very weird output
- I know this section of code may produce to me a 'unexpected' output that my program cannot handle

Your if-else statements are used to handle normal program flow, with **_standard conditions and inputs_**.

> wouldnt UML diagrams and the like become extremely messy once they grow bigger due to arrows skipping whole objects to go to their parents instead? As you mentioned, I would assume this is why the law of Demeter is considered important in a developer's coding practices

Yep, I had the same intuition as it may be hard to interpret due to all that skipping. 

I've had some discussions with others as well and the outcome of those discussions is that messiness *can* be bypassed sometimes.
- In an object diagram for example, you can just use Predicate&lt;T> if the context allows.
- As for class diagrams, I'm not too sure how we can address that tricky scaling. Using a factory pattern instead is not only more conventional but opting for that instead taps upon our "common sense" as developers

As for assumption on law of Demeter, I would think so as well. It keeps code modular and loosely coupled for reasons like this.

Hello! For me, I would lean towards not in scope if you stated in your UG something along the lines of:

"Editing the json file may lead to some unexpected errors."

The purpose of that sentence in the guideline is to hedge yourself as well against behaviours purposely trying to break your program. The tough part on whether to follow through with labelling it with NotInScope is discerning whether that behaviour is purposely trying to break the program or if its "natural" wrt to your users.

I agree with @TheresiaOng but my reasoning is different. From my view, the counter increase doesn't feel like a notable step in the interaction we are modelling. Instead, it feels something that the system does in the background as the interaction goes on.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Trying to fix Issues with vscode (tP)**
</div>

# DO NOT FOLLOW THIS GUIDE, I have not figured it out yet.
This issue aims to solve several related problems:

- #206 
- #202 
- #159
- #106 

**Goal:** Set VSCode extensions to use the correct java runtime.
- Make use of the UI for the Java & Gradle extensions in VSCode

Assuming you've cloned the repository, and installed the correct extensions:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack

Add these configurations to your .vscode/settings.json in your project directory:
'''.vscode/settings.json
``{``
  "java.jdt.ls.java.home": "/path/to/your/javazulu17/java/17.0.14.fx-zulu",
  "java.import.gradle.java.home": "/path/to/your/javazulu17/java/17.0.14.fx-zulu"
``}``
'''
Please rename the path to wherever you installed your Java 17. As a reference, here's mine: 
'''.vscode/settings.json
``{``
  "java.jdt.ls.java.home": "/Users/alroy/.sdkman/candidates/java/17.0.14.fx-zulu",
  "java.import.gradle.java.home": "/Users/alroy/.sdkman/candidates/java/17.0.14.fx-zulu"
``}``
'''
Remember to add  "/.vscode/" to your team's gitignore, or to ".git/info/exclude". (I did the latter.)

If this applies to you, I hope this helps. It had been plaguing me for **far too long**.
I spent quite a lot of time debugging mine, and am open to assist anyone else who also refuses to switch to IntelliJ at the moment.

Here's to yet another rabbithole of errors to fix.

**5. :fas-info-circle: Wrong name format for github organization**
</div>

Hello all,

TLDR; can i use the name 
"AY2526S1-CS2103-T09-01" 
for my github organization with my teammates in it instead of 
"AY2526S1-CS2103-T09-1"

I've recently deleted an organization under the name "AY2526S1-CS2103-T09-1", because I selected the wrong option under "This organization belongs to"

<img width="463" height="146" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a7fb6a-ad52-4142-aa10-31b7c01f0d8d" />

To rectify this, I was unfortunately too hasty in deleting the old organization to create a new one with the correct option selected.

As I was trying to create the new organization, the prompt said that "AY2526S1-CS2103-T09-1" is unavailable. this is likely because theres apparantly a 90 day hold on the name after deleting the old organization.

<img width="756" height="116" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e67d7cc6-962d-49bf-b55e-b8479cfa5367" />

I found sources that told me I should've renamed the old organization instead of deleting it (so theres no 90 day hold on the name after deleting the old organization) but unfortunately I've already deleted it.

Again, unfortunately it is not possible to recover the organization itself since i'm not on Github enterprise server, only the repositories under the organization can be restored.

<img width="790" height="282" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d9a3a80-fc6e-45ec-975b-9ddaa36dd208" />

This, combined with Github's support tickets needing 1-2 months before a response, means that there's not much I can do right now to make "AY2526S1-CS2103-T09-1" available for use. 

__Can I ask__ if our group's gh org can just use the name, and still have the grading scripts work with 
"AY2526S1-CS2103-T09-01"
instead of the correct format 
""AY2526S1-CS2103-T09-1"?

**6. :fas-info-circle: CheckStyle wants lambda expressions brackets to be line separated**
</div>

The line :
```
 <module name="SeparatorWrap">
      &gt;!-- Checks that the ",", "]", "[", "...", ";", "(" is at the previous end of line in a line wrap. -->
      <property name="tokens" value="COMMA, RBRACK, ARRAY_DECLARATOR, ELLIPSIS, SEMI, LPAREN"/>
      <property name="option" value="eol"/>
    </module>
```
in checkstyle.xml makes the code:
```
        InvalidTaskTypeException exception = assertThrows(
                InvalidTaskTypeException.class,
                () -&gt; Task.fromString(taskString)); // error on this line
```
to have a separatorWrap error when running checkstyle, because the lambda expression's brackets aren't separated by a line.

It seems that this isn't expected behaviour considering that Google's Java Style Guide also states that:
<img width="1185" height="341" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afe3c4f1-ff11-4c66-8d21-dd61c319185e" />
> A line is never broken adjacent to the arrow in a lambda" - This means you should NOT break the line right before or after the -&gt; arrow.
1. Is this expected behaviour
2. If so, has anyone found a way to get their java formatter to format it like so:
```
(
) -&gt; Someclass.doSomething()
```

If not, are we allowed to edit the checkstyle.xml to stop this from throwing an error

Thanks everyone for taking the time to test and share your feedback! Really appreciate the bug reports and suggestions across different systems—it’s been super helpful.

@oilyfishball I’ve gone ahead and fixed the corrupted save file bug you pointed out and have re-released the updated version. as v0.2.

@crimsonchaos02 I haven't implemented corrupted file handling as it is a stretch goal, but maybe I will next week. Thanks for pointing it out.

I'll leave this thread open if there's anyone else who wants to contribute, otherwise I'll be closing it next week. Thanks again everyone!

Nevermind, ~to maintain my sanity~, after spending considerable time troubleshooting, I’ve decided to switch to IntelliJ for now in order to maintain productivity and avoid further delays.

I'll just leave what I've found and what errors are left below in case anyone is curious.

https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/3627
I think it should be the "Test Runner for Java" that has a lot of compatibility issues. the repo is full of people saying they need to keep changing versions. I'm not able to fix it and have errors display properly on vscode. I guess I'll just move over to IntelliJ. If anyone has any suggestions please feel free to leave them below. Hopefully it's just a problem with my setup.
Here's the errors I'm trying to fix:

> hey, a follow up question when you run "./gradlew clean build" is there any other jar file generated in the build/libs/ folder? cause for me when i run the clean build command there are 2 jar files generated, one with all the dependencies included and one without. The one without the dependencies is the same name as my project folder which is ip. In other words I have an ip.jar and James-v1.0.0.jar (my chatbot name and version) that are generated, the ip.jar will not work whereas the other one does.

Hi, thank you for replying! Yes there are 2 files, one called ip.jar, and have size only ~180kb, one is winnie.jar which is what I uploaded

@ZhuRong818 I think that depends on the granularity of the requirements. At this level it's fine, but If we consider the control-flow paths inside .contains(s) call, they will be different.

**6. :fas-info-circle: tP Team Organization Naming Convention**
</div>

For week 6, one task for tP was creating the GitHub organization for our team, and it was stated very clearly in highlight that organization name should be all UPPER-CASE.

So, my team followed that and named our organization "AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08A-2" with an UPPER-CASE "A". 

But when I checked other teams, it seems a few others named their organization differently, e.g. AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-1 and AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-1 with a lower-case "a" and "b" respectively.

Given that it was stated following the format precisely is important for the grading scripts to work, I'd like to ask as confirmation what the correct naming convention is, and if there is any penalty or anything we need to worry about if we change the organization name at this stage.

Create a new ByteArrayOutputStream() 
Use System.setOut to change the output stream to your new output stream
Then you can call toString on your output stream to use in assertEquals

> [@gooZXSean](https://github.com/gooZXSean) It should be `AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-2` (you can just just edit the name of your org to rectify this)

Thank you Prof @damithc for clarifying. 

If I may suggest, it may be clearer to include `AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08b-2` as one of the examples in the instructions on the website. I feel that the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">(all UPPER CASE)</span> really implies the org name must be, well, all UPPER CASE, which may be misleading.

If you look at how the other existing commands are implemented, you just need to import `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`.

<img width="785" height="679" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eff7c2a8-bed8-48ad-ad2f-676a9a146cc0" />

In IntelliJ and I assume other IDEs you can right click this to select "Find Usages". Looking at its declaration, it is a lambda function that just returns true. Looking at how it is used, it is passed into `updateFilteredPersonList`, which updates the filter for the person list based on the input filter predicate (as described in the javadoc).

I'm guessing this implies that `model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` tells the model to update the filtered person list to be that of no filter (all persons shown).

Looking at your PR [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/ip/pull/429)

Referencing what '@jvvvstin' mentioned earlier you can quickly achieve the remaining items as follows:

- Create a heading by using '#' for Heading 1. '##' for H2 and '###' for H3 e.g.
'''md
# H1
some text
## H2
something else?
### H3
... mew mew
'''

- Fenced code block (different from inline code that only uses 1 enclosing backtick) with (java syntax highlighting) by using:
''''md
''' java
//YOUR HIGHLIGHT CODE HERE e.g.
System.out.println("abc123");
return 123;
'''
''''
Inline code looks something like this 'System.out.println("hello world");' (I saw that this was implemented in your PR comment)
'''md
Inline code looks something like this 'System.out.println("hello world");'
'''

- Blockquotes by using '> SOME TEXT' e.g.
'''md
> SOME TEXT
'''

Other than these 3, pretty sure you have done the rest 👍

I do believe what the Prof. is trying to say in a roundabout manner here
> To reiterate our guidelines, anything that can be implemented/corrected in a future version to make the product better should be response.NotInScope.

Is that with regards to the PE, we need to consider if the scenario presented by the tester is within the realm of reason.  
That is to say, `"Is what your application doing, considered sufficient and reasonable given the testing state?"`

It does seem like you figured out that there is indeed a better way to handle the issue rather than just saying the data cannot be saved, so kudos on that.

To add on specifically to the solution, I do believe the core idea here is that it is a reasonable expectation for the application to have to handle possible write protected environments, and provide alternative options to save the AddressBook, possibly through a file picker as mentioned by your team mate (this assumes that the testing environment is fair and at there exists directories that you can write to).

As such, the issue should probably be classified as `NotInScope` as there is still room for improvement 👍

You might have to be more specific on what you meant by

> causing bug in the app

as that would help you and others work out if it handles problems with the save file at a similar level with AB3.

That said, generally as long as a removal of a JSON field does not crash the application and just starts the application safely with a clean AddressBook, I do believe that it has achieved AB3 levels of file editing support.

I do believe another factor to consider is whether the modification follows your intended JSON format as well. E.g. If the tester abides by the JSON format set out by the application, but there is still a bug that arises, it may indicate that the application itself may be at fault as it failed to handle the data correctly. 

From the [level of support required:](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html#editing-the-data-file)
> Caution: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

Essentially means that
* If the JSON format is invalid and you discard all data, that is fine
* Invalid values are handled correctly when loaded from the save file (ref point 1)

In that sense, I do believe that if the application cannot detect that there is something wrong, it will constitute a bug (as the user clearly didn't realise that there is something wrong too).

Personally, sounds like a `NotInScope`. Essentially it comes down to how easy it even is for a user to activate the `clear` command. If your team's application does not offer tab completion (which means you cannot easily achieve `clear`+`enter keypress` with minimal human actions), the user would have had to **wilfully** type `c` `l` `e` `a` `r`, then hit enter.

or copy `clear`, paste it into the command box, and press enter

Which to me, does not require a safeguard (the confirmation step) as the user has had to have the intention to type it. Additionally, if your application makes backups for every command executed or provides undo functionality, it is even more irrelevant.

Just up to how you want to justify and challenge tester issues.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Question about time control in exam**
</div>

## My experience doing the test paper

The questions which references models drew in part 1 of the exam came slightly later in the exam(due to randomization), and I sped through most of them with relative easy, as they mostly require looking at my drawn models and finding what matches properly, so (unless the actual exam makes them significantly more difficult) it would be inaccurate to say that they are of the "same difficulty". 

## How do we properly estimate how much time to take then

Considering we cannot return to previous questions or skip questions, pacing is therefore key, but if there is a significant portion 5-10/30 of the questions that will take significantly less time than 2 minutes, a 2 minutes per question strategy is therefore inappropriate. So, for most students, this will come down to luck then? If you get the part 1 questions early, you can more accurately estimate how much time to take for the rest of the paper, but if you get it late, then you'll have to either:
1. speed through most of the paper at an optimistic (2 - 2:30 / question pace)
2. hope that they are of similar difficulty as the test paper, and that there is enough of them to create a buffer that allows you to spend more time on the rest of the paper.

Suppose two classes `A` and `B`, that are (in the domain model) referencing each other through an association class `AtoB`, but in code, `A` does not hold a reference of `B` and the same is true the other way around, meaning all of the code for this particular association lives in `AtoB`. 

Since in UML diagrams we are interested in modelling the domain, do we still draw this as a:

bidirectional association between `A` and `B` with `AtoB` attached to that association as an association class(and this class would only show the "additional association info" and omit the reference it has to `A` and `B`), 

or would it be more accurate to connect `A` to `AtoB` and `B` to `AtoB` respectively.

This is what I copied from the Week 2 Quiz. I know this is a bit nitpicky but is it not inaccurate to say that this statement is true. Considering that in git, unedited files are essentially shared across commits, meaning that a commit does not contain a **copy of all tracked files**, but more of a pointer to a blob storing the file? I am aware that it stores a snapshot of all files but the way it does it is not through a **copy**, but more like a symlink(hash)?

I also face this issue, where if you tried to copy from ACTUAL.TXT to EXPECTED.TXT, the IDE actually "helps" you to remove some spaces or white space characters. You can visualize this on a unix system using `cat -A filename`. A solution to this is to go through your entire code and remove anything that potentially prints a trailing whitespace character.

I checked your files with `cat -A <fileName>` and the results are as follows($ is new line):
ACTUAL.TXT
```
Enter task: $
------------------------- --------- $
```

EXPECTED.TXT
```
Enter task:$
------------------------- ---------$
```

The problem is indeed trailing whitespace characters that your IDE happily helped you remove. Since it is likely that you intend to keep these whitespace characters, another solution would be to use find and replace to replace `Enter task:` with `Enter task: ` in EXPECTED.TXT

The lifeline of an object only shows if it is still being referenced at that point of time in the execution of the program (whether the tasks are executed in parallel does not affect it, unless they are dereferenced within that parallel execution, which is difficult to do in Java). Since there is no mention of the `CloudServer` and `LocalData` objects' references, and considering they were constructed outside the parallel path, I do not think it is intentional.

> i agree. i feel that even the other questions (not part 1 questions) some could take easily &lt;1min (if as per the practice paper difficulty) so its hard to pace in exam (people who get 'easy' questions early are at an advantage)

I am mostly fine with that, unless you're crazily lucky(or unlucky), its most likely that you will get a mix of the "hard" and "easy" questions. But for the part 1 questions, as far as I can tell, they are grouped together by parts, meaning, with relatively high possibility (unless examplify got some safeguard against that), you can get all of the part 1 questions in the first half of you questions, or on the second half

I have nothing against the grouping of the questions, its a nice QOL after all, I am just stating that grouping the questions together statistically reduces the number of permutations, which means luck plays a bigger factor.

I also know that it is too late to change anything to the current format, so we might as well deal with it. But just my thoughts and a potential area for future improvement.

**6. :fas-info-circle: CodeCov how to handle case where method cannot be tested**

I have written a few methods for handling UI features, and those codes can't really be tested (they require JavaFX components to be initialized). When doing a PR, CodeCov keeps mentioning that the code is not covered by test cases, and I can't seem to keep the CodeCov at around 75%. May I ask how I should approach this issue? Thank you!

**1. :fas-info-circle: Inheritance with abstract classes in UML diagrams**
</div>

In the textbook it shows that when a class inherits another class/implements an interface, the parents' methods gets copied over as seen below:

<img width="1186" height="603" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c2a4984-7701-4e83-ba30-c7b503a65adb" />

However in one of the UML exercise videos, the class `Action` does not seem to copy over the `repeat()` method of the interface `Repeatable`, though it implements it, as seen below:

<img width="1573" height="1179" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b85ddcbd-4151-4696-9ff1-2ca4f5a20e62" />

Here are my questions:

- Is this because `Action` is an abstract class, hence it need not explicitly show its inherited `repeat()` method? 
- If the `repeat()` method was shown inside the abstract class, will it be deemed wrong?

Hi @damithc, you mentioned in issue #536 that:

since you said "if it is not obvious", does this mean it is not compulsory to add a team response on why we consider a bug a duplicate of the original if it is an obvious enough duplicate? 
I am confused as one of the criteria for a team response was if we "chose it as a duplicate of another bug", which implies that it is compulsory to comment on all duplicate bugs.

Thanks for your quick response!

> So, to answer this question, no, it is not because `Action` is an abstract class, but because `Action` class does not modify / override the `repeat()` method inherited from the `Repeatable` interface.

This makes sense, however I found another example in the examplify practice paper which may indicate otherwise.

For this question, the `UiWidget` class had no code shown and only the statement:
> `UiWidget` class inherits the `ProgressWatcher`

<img width="1261" height="550" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdfd489a-58a6-452f-b9c0-a2daaa81182c" />

Since there was no mention of overriding any methods from the `Watcher` interface, I would assume this would mean that `UiWidget` class need not indicate the `+update(int)` method, yet it does as seen here:

<img width="1082" height="581" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51dadfb0-2738-4008-a062-108957944987" />

After reading some stuff online, I think it may be because:
1. Methods are by default abstract in interfaces (unless otherwise stated)
2. Abstract classes are allowed to leave abstract methods from interfaces unimplemented, whereas concrete classes are not (they have to implement the abstract methods, as concrete classes CANNOT contain abstract methods)

I'm still not entirely sure, though. Would greatly appreciate some feedback on this.

Hi @LABDHH, have you tried adding '''source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"''' to your shell config file?

1. in terminal, open your shell config file.
bash → '''~/.bashrc (or ~/.bash_profile on macOS) '''
zsh → '''~/.zshrc'''
_if you get permission denied, you can try appending `nano` to the command_
2. Then add this line at the end:
'''source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"'''
3. Save and Exit
4. Reload your shell
'''source ~/.bash_profile # or ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc'''
5. Set a permanent default java version
'''sdk default java &lt;version>'''
_replace `&lt;version>` with the installed one_

LGTM. Tested on MacOS!
There seems to be an issue when creating tasks with names that match or contain command keywords and persistence.
---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Task name conflicts**
- Try creating a todo task named `todo`
   <img width="800" height="629" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42119f54-db77-4877-88d3-bfba485a99aa" />

- Try creating a task where the name includes command names as substrings. E.g. `event1`
   <img width="821" height="743" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9280d61-af61-4a8f-8f6b-f6ddd7f705c5" />

2. **Persistence failure**
   - Expected tasks to persist between runs.  
   - Instead, the bot does not close after `bye` and manually closing the application prints in the terminal:  
  ```
  No such file or directory
  No such file or directory
  /store/tasks.txt (No such file or directory)
  ```

---

## Expected Behavior

- The bot should allow tasks to be named freely, even if the task name matches or contains reserved command keywords.
- Tasks should persist between runs without errors.  

---

## Actual Behavior

- Task creation fails if the name matches a command (e.g., `todo`).
- Task creation fails if the name includes command names as substrings.
- Persistence fails with a missing file error

---

## Environment

- **OS:** MacOS
- **Bot version:** v0.2

Thank you for the help. i have tried these fixes:

1. The JavaFX plugin, by @FisherSkyi 
<img width="753" height="541" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c36b47f7-c915-46f2-8fea-49cc0fb4c0f9" />

2. Gradle plugin by @jovnc 

3. Invalidate Caches @damithc 

4. Deleting all 'run configurations'

5. Cloning the repo + set up Intellij again
 
6. Adding VM options to Run Configurations `-Dprism.order=sw -Dprism.verbose=true`

However, I still get the same error `java.lang.RuntimeException: Error initializing QuantumRenderer: no suitable pipeline found`

Regarding the JavaFX plugin, I noticed it requires IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. Would that be necessary?

Hi @pranav3142 , thanks for the suggestion!

@damithc I found the issue with the assistance of @rk2k3. The issue was building the project with the following Gradle dependencies:

''' gradle
implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
'''

# Root Cause
1. Incorrect JavaFX classifier

2. The dependencies specify classifier: `mac`, which is for Intel macOS binaries.

3. On Apple Silicon, apparently the JVM cannot load these libraries.

4. The correct classifier should be `mac-aarch64`

# Solution
**1. Update the classifier**

'''
implementation "org.openjfx:javafx-base:$javaFxVersion:mac-aarch64"
implementation "org.openjfx:javafx-controls:$javaFxVersion:mac-aarch64"
implementation "org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:$javaFxVersion:mac-aarch64"
implementation "org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:$javaFxVersion:mac-aarch64"
'''
_I used string notation here but map notation also works:_
`implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac-aarch64'`

**2. Use this SDK in File > Project Structure > Project > SDK**

**Full Dependency:**
'''
dependencies ``{``
    String jUnitVersion = '5.4.0'
    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.7'

    // JavaFX dependencies
    implementation "org.openjfx:javafx-base:$javaFxVersion:win"
    implementation "org.openjfx:javafx-base:$javaFxVersion:mac-aarch64"  // Apple Silicon

**1. :fas-info-circle: Justification for parent issue**
</div>

Hello, seeking clarification as I believe a question posted was not clarified:

> As an extension to qn 1, this section in the course website states that the team comment of the original bug will also be shown with the duplicate justification. But what if we are accepting the original bug as is (which usually does not require a response)? Does this mean that in the case of it being a 'parent' bug, it also needs a comment?

 _Originally posted by @pokedot in [#542](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2526S1/forum/issues/542#issuecomment-3512387982)_

To restate the question, if we are accepting the "parent" issue as is, would we need to provide a justification for it? Because in the case where the "parent" issue is accepted as is, the "child" issue would not get a parent comment (assuming that we follow the guidelines of not needing to write a team justification message for accepting a bug as is)

**4. :fas-info-circle: Gradle menu not looking like expected**
</div>

When following https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html#adding-gradle-to-the-project, under step 3 `Confirm the correct Java version is being used for Gradle:`, my settings window for Gradle looks like this:

<img width="1467" height="889" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/064a8272-612f-46c8-8d16-daa17b0fe9a9" /> (image 1)

instead of what it should look like in the link. I thought IntelliJ was not recognising my `build.gradle`, so I tried troubleshooting, but nothing seems to be appearing. Strangely enough, I have access to the Gradle toolbar:

<img width="310" height="205" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de37873f-5bc7-4692-9ccd-49a4eab065c0" /> (image 2)

and I can even run tasks and all. Going to the settings page through the Gradle toolbar leads back to the same place in image 1, and nothing still appears.

How do I go about resolving this issue?

Thank you for the prompt reply, Prof @damithc!
> [@kin-chong](https://github.com/kin-chong) If you accept the parent issue as-is, no need to write a justification for it. In that case the duplicates will not show the justification of the original issue either (because there is none). But if any of the duplicates had a higher severity which is now overridden by a lower severity of the original issue, you'll need to justify lowering the severity to the tester of that duplicate (which you can do in the team comment of _that_ duplicate). 

Just one last point of clarification; if we are not lowering but instead **increasing** the severity of the "child" issue, am I right in understanding that we still need to write a team justification message for why it is a duplicate of the "parent" issue?

Hi @zhenglong1603

> are you using two debuggers by any chance?

Thanks! that was it!

I solved the problem by 1) running
```
$ netstat -ano | findstr :5005
$ taskkill /F /PID 31804 /#PID number
$ .\gradlew.bat run --debug-jvm
```

2) and also placing this magical file in tp/.vscode/launch.json (thx chatgpt):

```
``{``
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        ``{``
            "type": "java",
            "name": "Debug JavaFX App",
            "request": "attach",
            "hostName": "localhost",
            "port": 5005
        ``}``
    ]
``}``
  
```

3) then click the run and debug button (now renamed to "Debug JavaFX App")

Unfortunately, I have to re-run these commands (to kill the previous instance of debugger on port 5005) every single time I wish to deo debugging, otherwise I get this:

Invalid tasks (eg marking tasks out of range) does not result in error, but just unable to send the command. perhaps visual indication (eg error  message or red text) could be good here. Otherwise, everything else works!

Hi @damithc ,

My changes have not been overwitten, and has been merged to the team repo.

In Reposense, it sees my puml updates as a binary:

<img width="1320" height="702" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbfe7da1-ae36-48e6-afc0-0956ec74cb97" />

Yet on github, in the commit, I can see each lines changed.
In the pull request however, I see the binary only, no lines.

<img width="598" height="90" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b82e588-a370-4150-8b3c-92785087e8d4" />

How can I make my changes visible to the script, so that it is able to detect my changes?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Reporting a but when the requirement was stated for PE testing**
</div>

A bug was created for our group, which violates an instruction for the testing of the JAR file (write permissions of the folder). The bug claims that it should have been explicitly stated in the requirements in the UG. However, this is expected of almost every application, and since this was stated explicitly in the PE testing instructions, we intentionally left it out. Is it fine to reject this bug?

The website mentions that data and config files are not in scope, **unless they affect the app behavior**. Can I ask what does this mean exactly? For example, if modifying the data file in some way results in the app not being able to launch, does this count as a valid bug for PE-D?

Hi, for students who are using a different Java version than the intended target (17), you can add the following to ensure cross compilation for the appropriate Java version 17. Add this to your `build.gradle` file:

'''gradle
java ``{``
    toolchain ``{``
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)
    ``}``
``}``
'''

That being said, please still do your smoke testing!

Yes, JavaDoc comments for overridden methods can be omitted.
> You MUST write header comments for all classes, public methods. But they can be omitted for the following cases:
> i. Getters/setters
> ii. When overriding methods (provided the parent method's Javadoc applies exactly as is to the overridden method)
> 
> Reference: https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#comments

That being said, sometimes the overridden method is not sufficiently described by the JavaDoc comment of the function that it overrides. In these situations, it is still recommended to write a JavaDoc comment to explain why the specific method is overridden.

I would instead suggest setting the executable bit on the file itself and committing the executable bit onto your version control system, instead of setting the execute bit in your Github workflow.

This is possible on windows as well:

'''bash
git add --chmod=+x -- runtest.sh
'''

@damithc This is regarding functionality bugs, where 2 functionality bugs can be solved by fixing the code in a single location. But what about documentation bugs? The rules do not explain duplicate documentation bugs across different commands. For context, our group is facing a similar issue regarding `mark` and `unmark` commands - both of which are basically tied around attendance.

Does the app launch correctly? i.e. no path error, can input text (e.g. HelLo or hI, case not matter) in text field and send by clicking button, then use list and see if the bot give an empty list.

Yes, this works for me.

Use bye to exit, then launch again, use command list and see if task(s) stored previously is loaded correctly.

This works for me as well. 

Overall everything looks good, error handling is great too!

For me I would prompt the user to start with either todo, deadline, event, delete, list, mark or unmark which is what we did up till level 6 so it wouldn't accept "walk".  But if you want to consider it as a valid input then it's your choice on how you want it to be saved since it wasn't mentioned. Maybe create another type of task like other so you won't mix up with todo?

i got the same issue as you and it was because it is set at "current file" at default when i click run and i was in the main class. You should either set the default to launcher when u click run or go to launcher class and click run.

Like what the previous comment mentioned, i think its great if you can adjust the chatbot.

It works as it should on wsl :). Just a suggestion to better improve your chatbot: It might be better if you can throw in an error message for deadline and event if user didn't input the time in the right format so they know right away and wouldn't have to find your user guide for the correct format.

Command all works. What I like is the flexibility of the dates (accepts tomorrow, next friday etc). 👍 
Two things that can be improved is: the resizing of the gui (see last pic) and that after typing bye, the gui closes immediately and i am unable to see the goodbye message.

.
Your functions work as advertise while handling the common errors well (eg invalid time, .invalid task number). After closing and reopening the chatbot, I could still see the tasks from previous session 👍 .
However if i type ` todo test` with a space at the front, it wouldn't recognise that as a valid input. I suggest adding the trim() method somewhere.

Otherwise it looks good to me. I like the design and personality of the chatbot.

@damithc 

Hi prof, regarding grading of code quality. I was wondering given a 70 lines of code function. Is it better to abstract out this method into seperate functions halfway which means i violate SLAP or to leave it as it is with a long method which could also be a violation of SLAP. Which of the 2 would be a better option for code quality

Or can i abstract some parts of the code into function eg defensive checks and leave the rest of the code 

Thank you

For composition, it's the whole-part relationship. The whole is made up of the parts. When you delete the whole, the parts of course will be gone. For example, a book is made of chapters. If you throw away the book, the chapters are gone.

For aggregation, it's the contained-container relationship. The contained is only inside the container but not part of the container. For example, you bought a kiwi box. You then throw away the box and keep the kiwi.

In the context of OOP, the kiwi will still exist regardless of the existence of the box, similar to a normal generic association. What's the point for us to show aggregation if it's just like any other association? On the other hand, composition is a stronger association. The whole can't exist without the parts. The parts define the whole. What is a book without any chapters? But the kiwi surely remains after you throw away the box.

A class diagram defines the rule of relationships between classes. It shows the static structure, abstract and timeless.
An object diagram is a snapshot of the actual relationships between objects in action. It shows the static structure and time-specific.

The main key here is static. Dependency is transient(temporary). It's fleeting and not important. It's like taking a photograph of a group of people; the photo shows who is in the room and where they are standing (their state), but it doesn't capture the brief conversation one person is having with another at that exact instant. Imagine how convoluted and trivial it is to draw speech balloons on the photo.

I think it just simply not the focus of UML.

Works perfectly fine on windows 11. One small thing I noticed is that if I enter mark or unmark without the task number I am not able to click enter, if that is a feature it is great. Also the message for unmarked says "Ok, I've unmarked this task as done yet:" not sure if it supposed to mean "Ok, I've unmarked this task as not done yet:", just wanted to let you know, otherwise works great!

In other words I have an ip.jar and James-v1.0.0.jar (my chatbot name and version) that are generated, the ip.jar will not work whereas the other one does.

I am using Windows and setup my Personal Access Token (PAT) via HTTPS. Below is the exercise outline:

<br> I am sure I did it correctly, otherwise, it would have given me the following output which suggest that the indicated remote URL is wrong. In this screenshot below the difference is that I ran `git remote add upstream https://github.com/its-me-orion/link-this.git` instead of `git remote add upstream https://github.com/its-me-orion/git-mastery/link-me.git`

<img width="879" height="372" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5dca083-e465-485e-a64d-b2e4e2638747" />

<br> Some of the URL commands I tried are as follows:

- https://github.com/``{``username``}``/link-this.git
- https://github.com/``{``username``}``/git-mastery/link-me.git
- https://github.com/``{``username``}``/git-mastery/link-me

- https://github.com/``{``username``}``/git-mastery/link-me/link-this.git

<br> If you are trying to help me you can quickly reset the thing, run `git remote remove upstream` instead of `gitmastery progress reset`. I ensured that my github username is correct and I also tried removing the entire directory using `rm -rf link-me/` and redownloading it but it gave me the same problem.

<br> I am not sure what I am doing wrong and whether if this is a verification bug.

@damithc Yes, I managed to get it to work but just so I am understanding the difference regarding this. Doing `https://github.com/``{``username``}``/git-mastery/link-me.git` means I am creating a remote repo (forking) under my username but doing `https://github.com/git-mastery/link-me.git` is sort of like pulling an already existing public remote repo right?

Also I have reported the bug to git-mastery.

@deniseegohh 

Could you try verifying again that `gitmastery.exe` is indeed in the correct directory by following these steps:
1. Using Git Bash navigate to the directory containing gitmastery.exe using the `cd` command
2. Check that `gitmastery.exe` is in the directory using the `ls` command
3. Run `pwd -W` command which stands for Print Working Directory to get directory path
4. Verify that the output is exactly the same as the one you added to `PATH`

Reference screenshot (Note that where I put my `gitmastery.exe` may be different from yours:

@deniseegohh could it be that you added the folder in `PATH` under User variables instead of the `PATH` under System variables? Also if this is not the case, you could try restarting Git Bash or maybe your computer and see if your system is able to recognise `gitmastery` as a command in Git Bash

This error seems like it is a problem within your `MainWindow.fxml`, could you send what is in your `MainWindow.fxml` file?

Edit: To add on to this, your `MainWindow.fxml` should not have `&lt;fx.root>` if you meant to use it as an anchor pane
'''fxml
&lt;fx.root>
&lt;!-- Code here -->
&lt;/fx.root>
'''

Instead, the structure should be something like:
'''fxml
&lt;AnchorPane fx:controller="``{``location.to.MainWindow``}``">
&lt;!-- Code here -->
&lt;/AnchorPane>
'''

Take note ```{``location.to.MainWindow``}``` is the location of `MainWindow.java` from `src/main/java` onwards (e.g. if the file is at `src/main/java/duke/ui/MainWindow.java`, you should put in `duke.ui.MainWindow.java`.

Also note that the example start tag for `&lt;AnchorPane>` is incomplete as there is as it required other mandatory attributes like `xmlns:fx`.

That probably explains why, to fix it you just have to change the FXML tags `&lt;fx:root>&lt;/fx:root>` to `&lt;AnchorPane>&lt;/AnchorPane>`.

As for your attributes, u can omit the `type="AnchorPane"` part. Just remember to take note that `fx:controller` attribute is set correctly and your code should start working.

@julius-gwee @wuliyq @Ruinim @damithc 
I actually found a fix to this, what you need to do is rerun the failed test, then **MANUALLY** cancel the operation instead of letting it timeout and cancel itself after several retries. After manual cancellation, rerun the failed test and it should run as intended.

I got the solution from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76029677)

If it works for you guys also please let the people in this forum know as I think is a common issue.

I find it odd as well, is probably server-side thing, and yes after the manual cancellation fix, any subsequent PRs should not have this problem anymore.

I see that your actual output seem to contain extra whitespaces for all the:

Since this error only occur on these lines, try checking if there's any issue with them :)

The issue might be due to the paths used in runtest.bat being no longer valid due to the nesting. 
At line 10, for instance, runtest is looking for java code in the folder "java" to compile, but it's now empty with just the `mochi` package.
Try changing the path to go deeper into the directory and see if that helps :)

# Tested on Windows

The basic functionalities seem to work, good job 👍

I found some areas that could be improved on:

1. Due to fuzzy matching of the command prompt, certain "invalid" commands will be treated as valid.
It may be good to use exact matches instead, and provide a list of possible commands to the user :) 
Here are some examples:
- "test" (and "last" which is not included) is fuzzy matched to "list" <br><img width="500" height="338" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb54780-6027-4955-9b63-c114daad94b4" />
- "unmark" (which is not supported) is fuzzy matched to "mark" <br> <img width="500" height="421" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c63510a-0c96-4225-a531-e25b52f341dd" />

2. Currently the Task description seems to be checked after the dates. It might be better if it is checked first instead! <br> <img width="500" height="339" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ab91e1e-6cba-4627-ac0b-8d017d87f707" />

# Tested on Windows

Most of the basic functionalities seem to work, good job! 👍 <br>
Though I might have uncovered a bug in the `date` command: <br>

Other suggestions:
1. Currently, if unknown instructions are provided, Gray just asks for a "valid instruction" but does not provide reminders for the type of instructions the user can type. It might be good if that's added in!
2. On a similar note, if the user does not provide the date or uses a wrong specifier for the date, Gray only gives a broad reminder to "provide a ... date". It might be good to have reminders for the format of the instructions! <br> <img width="500" height="970" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd3d5e64-c68f-4887-82f7-997630227ad5" />

# Tested on Windows (Facing dependency issues)

Unfortunately, I was not able to test `yappy.jar` :( 
From the error messages, you might have missed out some dependencies, in particular the sound effects.
<img width="2338" height="1335" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7270d42-7b1e-42b4-866a-aeaddea0835f" />

I did see a veryy small UI thing that could be improved on:
Upon launching the app, the dialog box is already pushed off the screen slightly as the pane is taller than the window. It might be a good idea to restrict the default height so the dialog box is in view!

# Tested on Windows

The basic functionalities seem to work, good job 👍

I found some areas that could be improved on:
 1. Due to allowing either a string or a date in the date fields, errors in the date format is interpreted as string and saved, instead of being flagged out. If there is any logic within the code that makes use of date as a date object, this may lead to issues. <br> <img width="500" height="300" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea16c6b5-e543-434d-bb09-2241a4a8ac68" />
2. A previous tester mentioned that the presence validation for task description will be ignored if there are many spaces. From my testing, it seems that as long as the `/by` field is provided, an empty description is accepted. The issue is applicable for `Deadline` and `Event` <br> <img width="500" height="300" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4181682-6a2d-429f-98cd-6da2db61a93f" />
3. After `bye` is provided, the window stays on. It would be great if the program can terminate by itself :)

# Tested on Windows

All your specified commands work as intended, good job 👍 
I can tell that you put a lot of thought into this!

I found some potential areas of improvement:
1. The description presence check seems to be conducted after checking for the date fields. You could consider shifting the order so that the description is checked before the date fields for better user feedback :) <br> <img width="500" height="238" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c53edb5-1f14-404a-8b81-cfbb37e41f1a" />
2. Yappy's reply for both mark and unmark is the same. ("...marked this task as completed" for both) You might have missed out on editing it! <br><img width="500" height="290" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7ddfdb6-9e91-4e82-a588-a129aed03cdc" />
3. The `postpone` command seems to allow for preponing as well (no restriction on the date). You could consider renaming the command to reflect that <br><img width="500" height="449" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73a3dbad-9c1b-4e7d-94f9-648b725204dd" />
4. Attempts to postpone non-deadline tasks will lead to an uncaught `ClassCastException` instead of a warning from Yappy. <br><img width="2725" height="1241" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a705d8b-00b9-40bb-bf2f-cd449814c7ad" />

Small thing:
1. You might have missed out a space in your `toString()` for the `Event` class before the brackets for the dates <br><img width="500" height="183" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04d9df18-d1b6-4a32-8d0f-9b7fdc649cfb" />

 According to prof's response in #588 no visibility specifier means package private visibility, and we should put as many details as possible in part1 diagrams so we should use ~ for visibility specifier.

> If there is a dependency drawn as a dashed line with arrow, then do we still need to include it as the attribute in the class diagram?

From my understanding,  
If a class stores another object → use an association or store as an attribute but not both.
If a class only uses another temporarily(Passing as a parameter, using in a method etc. ) → use a dependency without an attribute.

If you add both attribute and dependency arrow
you are saying the class both stores and temporarily uses the same class. This might be redundant and misleading

According to the course web, EP separates inputs based on behaviour, not just output.

<img width="1718" height="204" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3baa728f-d9ec-4558-a30c-5db3b8ac22d8" />


Even though `"F"`, `"T"`, and `"D"` all cause the function to return `true`, the specification may treat them as distinct valid flags, which we should put them into different class. As for `["f","t","d"]` they are considered as invalid input due to lower case thus placed in the same EP

 the implementation may look like this:

'''java
if (s.equals("F")) return true;
if (s.equals("T")) return true;
if (s.equals("D")) return true;
return false;
'''

Then:

* `"F"` triggers one branch
* `"T"` triggers a different branch
* `"D"` triggers the third branch

Different branches → different behaviour → different EP.


From my understanding(pls correct me if wrong)
They are in same equivalence class only if code treated them identically, such as:

'''java
switch (s) ``{``
  case "F":
  case "T":
  case "D":
    return true;
``}``
'''

I think this treats T,F,D exactly the same as they all go through the same logic path,  so there is no different behaviour internally.

As long as  behaviourally these inputs are identical, we should put them into the same Equivalence class.

If I remembered correctly, in a UML sequence diagram, a par fragment shows the portion of the interaction that executes in parallel. The frame does not contain the entire lifeline of the objects, it only contain the  parts of the lifelines that participate in the parallel behavior.

so I think it is intentional that the `CloudServer` and `LocalData` lifeline are placed inside the frame.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on Tester Response for Overlapping / Duplicated Feature**
</div>

Hi everyone, I would like to get some opinions on a PE-related matter (specific team not disclosed for fairness).

During PE, I encountered two commands in the app I was testing, let’s call them Feature A and Feature B.
From my analysis, Feature A is a strict superset of Feature B: it can perform all the actions Feature B does, and also supports additional editing/modification capabilities.

In contrast, Feature B can only perform a single, narrow action (e.g., purely assigning something). It cannot perform even basic edits. Because of this, Feature B felt not only redundant but also functionally weaker to the point that, as a standalone feature, it seemed flawed from a usability perspective.

Based on these observations, I raised a feature flaw in PE, arguing that Feature B duplicated functionality already fully covered by Feature A, with no additional benefits other than narrowing the scope.

The dev team rejected my issue. On the grounds that it is intended to be narrower for "usability". Yet with what was mentioned before I am unsure that it is just to dismiss my issue without coming up with a clearer explanation. 

Before I proceed with accepting/rejecting their response, I’d like to hear the class’s opinion:

* I have assigned this issue with type.FeatureFlaw and severity.Medium
* When a narrower feature is fully contained within a broader feature, is that considered acceptable design?
* Does having both commands make sense from a usability standpoint, or would it still be considered redundant?
* Would this typically count as a reasonable rejection or is it worth objecting?

Any guidance would be appreciated!

**4. :fas-info-circle: Should Command and Parsed stay nested inside Parser, or be separate Java files?**
</div>

In my current design, I’ve kept both the Command enum and the Parsed record inside the Parser class, like this:

'''java
public class Parser ``{``

    // ... parsing methods ...

    public enum Command ``{``
        BYE, LIST, MARK, UNMARK, DELETE, TODO, DEADLINE, EVENT
    ``}``

    public record Parsed(Command cmd, String args) ``{`` ``}``
``}``
'''
I kept both Command and Parsed inside the Parser class because they are tightly coupled to the parsing process and are not intended to be reused elsewhere.

Command only exists to represent the set of keywords that the Parser can recognise.

Parsed is just a simple container for the result of parsing (cmd + args).

By nesting them inside Parser, it is clear that they are part of the parsing logic’s domain, not general-purpose classes. This improves encapsulation: other parts of the code can still access them (Parser.Command, Parser.Parsed) when needed, but their scope and meaning stay closely tied to parsing.

Would this be considered good OOP practice (since they are conceptually tied to parsing)?

Or should I instead move Command and Parsed into their own separate .java files for better structure and maintainability? Also, is the use of the record feature in Java allowed?

My personal opinion is that this boils down to scope, readability, and reusability.

If the helper logic is very short, self-contained, and only used once or twice in the same method, a lambda is perfectly fine. It can make your code concise and avoid cluttering the class with too many small methods.

On the other hand, if the logic is longer, used in multiple places, or could benefit from having a descriptive name, then it is usually clearer to declare it as a separate method. That way, it is easier to test, reuse, and understand at a glance.

The best choice depends on which option makes your code more readable and maintainable. In practice, I use lambda for quick inline behaviour testing, then extract it into a named method later if it grows or is reused.

Thanks everyone, for pitching in and sharing your perspectives 🙏 

Really appreciate the variety of views here. It’s helpful to see how some of you prefer encapsulating related types (like `Command` and `Parsed`) directly inside the Parser for cohesion and to avoid misuse, while others lean towards separation for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility as the project scales.

I think the key takeaway is that both approaches are valid in Java (especially since Java 17 gives us more modern features like record), and the “best” choice depends on the context:

1) If the types are tightly coupled and unlikely to be reused elsewhere, nesting can make sense.
2) If you expect the commands/enums to grow in number or be reused, separating them into their own files may be a cleaner and more extensible design.

I’ll weigh both sides carefully for my own implementation. Thanks again for all the thoughtful input!

Like prof mentioned, JUnit tests don’t have to be limited to methods that return values; what matters is whether you’re testing the expected outcomes of your code. In our project, that can mean testing **state changes**, **exceptions**, or even **side effects**, not just return values.

Some examples from my own code:

**State changes:** after running TaskList.add() and TaskList.remove(), I check that the size updates and the correct task was removed.
'''java
TaskList list = new TaskList(new ArrayList&lt;>());
Todo t1 = new Todo("read book");
list.add(t1);
assertEquals(1, list.size());
assertSame(t1, list.get(0));
Task removed = list.remove(0);
assertSame(t1, removed);
assertEquals(0, list.size());
'''

**Exceptions:** for parsing, I check that invalid input is rejected.
'''java
assertThrows(MalformedArgumentsException.class, () ->
    Parser.splitDeadlineArgs("return book")); // missing /by
'''

**Conversions / logic:** for parseIndexOrThrow, I test that it correctly converts 1-based user input into 0-based indices, and that out-of-range inputs throw.
'''java
assertEquals(0, Parser.parseIndexOrThrow("1", 3));
assertThrows(ChattyException.class, () ->
    Parser.parseIndexOrThrow("4", 3)); // > size
'''

So even though the switch cases themselves don’t return values, you can still write meaningful tests by verifying their effects on TaskList, or by checking that the right exceptions are thrown when inputs are invalid.

This is me running the chatbot from intellij, as you can see it read and writes to the BobMortimer.txt file here.

Whereas due to what I presume is the placement of my jar file (although still under iP file), running the chatbot from my jar file reads and writes to a different BobMortimer.txt file. Is this ok or should I find a way to unify them to one file.

Let's say one of the main feature of the app have behavior that is not documented properly.

I believe this would be dependent on whether there are other places that the user can get a valid example from. Like error messages could have the correct example then the severity may just be low or medium. If there is no correct examples to be found anywhere, then it could possibly be a high severity bug. 

<img width="610" height="104" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/376ac486-16fe-4242-bb3b-41fa70ee8da0" />

Nevertheless, I would say its likely to be between low to medium depending on whether you think it is confusing to the user or not.

If you have to zoom to see the diagram it is likely to be too complex.

Nevertheless this would only be a cosmetic issue and will only qualify for very low severity. Unless you are able to find other issues within the diagram, that would instead be a higher severity. Refer to image below for guidance.

I think it is clear that the data will be accessible by multiple users and thus is certainly a violation of project constraint. I think it really depends on whether this "discover" feature is a main feature or something that isn't really used and shown in the app. If its the main component of the app then I would say it's a severity High feature flaw. Otherwise it would likely be just a low to medium feature flaw as it doesn't affect much.

If the edit feature is still there and this other feature only works to edit one attribute, may not exactly be a feature flaw. Really depends on what is the attribute they are editing through this feature. If you do think it is redundant then likely just a low severity because it does not really affect using of the program.

All functions work okay! Although I think your docs example for the 'event' command might be wrong (says to use /at instead of /from /to)
Since you are doing a reminder command, wondering if it would be weird to allow deadline tasks to be set dates before today but that is just something extra for you to consider

Here are my two cents, even with an abstract class there is also nothing stopping you from having your child command class inheriting from this abstract class and implementing another interface as an extension? Yes it prevents you from inheriting another abstract class but I don't think it is as limiting as you imagine?

One benefit I can think of from having future edits all be in this abstract class would be easier readability for whoever you pass your code to. I can imagine if you were to have implementations and abstract classes as extensions for those implementations to be inherited by other classes the code may be unnecessarily messy as compared to having all functions in one place?

Hi, I would like to ask if when we are responding to bugs we deem as duplicates, do we respond as if we they were not duplicates (ie. notInScope because we feel....)

Or are we just supposed to respond as to why this bug is considered a duplicate (ie. We think this bug is a duplicate of another bug as ....)

So basically the only bugs we do not have to respond to are those that we accept

Moreover, if we marked the "original" bug as notInScope, do we label the duplicates as notInScope as well?

I see, I had initially planned to have an error checking method that runs through most of not all of the possible errors before I attempt to process it further. 
However, after working on it for a while, i realised that it is some what inefficient to make exception cases 1 by 1 using if commands for each scenario.

I have currently decided on the method of using if conditions to check for the initial attempted command, the using try and catch in order to find out which error had occurred. Eventually getting the function to return the appropriate error code from which the exception class will print the appropriate message.

While admittedly somewhat messy I intend to split it into multiple smaller functions to make it easier to read

Thank you so much for the quick response. I got very worried that this would count as not fulfilling the criteria and i would have to resubmit my code.

Hi, I tested your cody.jar on my Mac. It doesn’t start up properly — I get an error:
“Unknown task type being read from file” and then a NullPointerException because this.cody is null.
Looks like the program is trying to load some data or config before launching, but it fails and leaves cody uninitialized. Maybe a missing/corrupted data file?

I don't think I see a Jar file for this version's release or is there something wrong on my end?

`list`/`mark`/`unmark` commands seems to be working as intended. Load/save is working too. But I did find some bugs involving illegal date/time entries using `deadline`/`event` command.

I've tested all the listed commands, all is working as intended. Good job! I like that the bot tells the user all the available commands when given an invalid input 👍

LGTM. I've tested `todo`, `deadline`, `event`, `mark`, `unmark`, `list`, `find` and `bye` commands. All is working as intended, I didn't manage to find any bugs so far, good job! And it is saving/loading the tasklist correctly.

I've tested the listed basic commands in the README. So far, everything is working as expected, good job! But I noticed the chatbot does not accept invalid inputs from the user and instead spits out exceptions in the terminal (as shown below). Moving on to Chat Features, I noticed that none of the greetings works except for `hi`, `hello` and `hey`. All in all, I like the grumpy personality of SumTingWong 😄 .

I tried running the app again and it could not start again (terminal shown below).

I've tested `list`, `todo`, `deadline`, `event`, `mark`, `unmark`, `delete`, `find` and `bye`, all seems to be working as intended, good job 😄 ! I can see some error handling and I like that the app tells the user specifically what the error is as shown below. 

I realised that when given an invalid command, the app shows the user a list of available commands, but `find` command seems to be missing in that list, even though it is implemented. Maybe consider making it show the full list of commands.

Firstly, I love the personality and the resizable window of the app 😃 

I've tested `list`, `todo`,  `deadline`, `mark`, `unmark`, `bye`, `delete` and `find`, seems to be working as intended, but I cannot seem to figure out the date/time format used by `event`. Tried using the format shown in the README too but still can't seem to get it to work 😢. Save/load seems to be working too, good job 😄 

<img width="642" height="41" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c83c917-c3a7-4c4a-bbf7-e224103dadad" />

Also, when using `deadline` with an invalid date/time input, the app does not let the user know about the invalid input and instead "hangs". I have added the error shown in the terminal below.

I like that there is a `help` command to guide users within the app itself 😄 

I've tested `todo`, `deadline`, `event`, `mark`, `list`, `find` and `bye`, all seems to be working as intended, good job! I can also see some error handling being done and I like that the app tells the user what is the issue specifically. Save/load seems to be working as intended too 😄 

I am wondering if we can implement a `unmark` command to unmark my marked task 🤔

I love that the window is resizable 😄 

I've tested all the basic commands, all seems to be working as intended, good job! I can see that there is sufficient error handling being done and like that the app tells the user what format to use specifically with examples 😄 

The `bye` command does not seem to close the app and instead "hangs" 😢 Other than that, save/load seems to be working correctly.

I've tested the basic commands, all seems to be working as intended 😄 I realised that when I used the `unmark` command, the task that is unmarked seems to be printed twice as shown below, is this intentional? Other than that, save/load is working correctly.

I can see sufficient error handling and like that the app tells the user whats wrong specifically and gives format examples, good job 😄 

`help` command does not seem to show all available commands 😢 . Specifically, `find` command is missing from it even though it is implemented as shown below.

An abstract class would be more representative of a "is-a" relationship between the parent class and the child classes as compared to an interface which is more like a "can-do" relationship. While interface can allow for greater flexbility, they could be shared among classes that are not related but just share a certain property. In this case since all variation of a command is a command, it would be more clearly represented as an abstract class.

How closely does the tP have to be to an addressbook or contact management?

under constraints--Brownfield it says The final product should be a result of evolving/enhancing/morphing the given codebase. However, you are allowed to replace all existing code with new code, as long as it is done incrementally. e.g., done in small steps, each producing a working product "

so does our tP still have to be in the form of an address book? or can we store and edit other information like notes or documents

Basic functionality works well, GUI loads correctly too. Love the color scheme.
The code provided runs as expected.

Can consider giving users a datetime format if they have entered it wrongly.
Can consider putting a title Seeyes on the window.
Small bug: if file was saved and corrupted, it will overwrite the task list to an empty one but display Load Success. (see below)

Forked the wrong repo and only realized this after pushing all your commits / increments? I happened to be in this position and I wanted to refork whilst preserve my existing commits / tags. I can't seem to anything regarding this on the [course website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/) so I just wanted to share what I did exactly to resolve this.

## Resolving

b. Ensure General tab is selected
<img width="245" height="369" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21909a9f-e7ee-4240-8a85-7654013e159c" />

c. Scroll down to delete your current fork

### Step 2: Refork from the correct repo

a. Navigate to the correct repo and fork
<img width="230" height="363" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97312e0f-e547-42a1-bb67-c6b632d9c71e" />

b. Name it `ip` and ensure that `Copy the master branch` is unchecked.
<img width="311" height="464" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd8a35e6-6f4d-4607-9be0-197561ee5d05" />

### Step 3: Pull from the updated fork to your local repo
a. Run `git remote -v` to ensure your local repo is still pointed to remote. There should be no change here as we are using the same repo name of `ip`.
<img width="817" height="233" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23953aec-6376-4019-a549-fbb7412b82ed" />

b. Run `git config pull.rebase false` to tell Git that you want to merge the changes when facing divergent branches.

> When you set git config pull.rebase false, you explicitly tell Git to avoid using the rebase strategy when pulling changes. Instead, it ensures that Git will always merge the changes. This configuration is particularly useful if you want to maintain the exact history of changes, including merge commits.

c. Run `git pull`

### Step 4: Push to the new fork

a. Run `git push origin` to push all your existing commits
<img width="631" height="283" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf7275d0-f1f5-4524-acd4-1f3f453a37ee" />

b. Run `git push --tags origin` to push all your existing tags

All the tests should be reflected as passing

**2. :fas-info-circle: Is tagging case-insensitive?**
</div>

Out of a personal oversight, I tagged my commit as A-BetterGUI over A-BetterGui, and named my branch branch-A-BetterGui. Github does not allow me to rename my tag/branch from one to the other, which leads me to believe tagging is case-insensitive. I was wondering what was the best way to go about renaming these tags, so as to ensure my commit is detected by the system. Thank you so much for any assistance!

**3. :fas-info-circle: Dashboard issues or wrongly merged commits/tags?**
</div>

I have recently completed the A-CodingStandard, A-JavaDoc, and A-Level-9 increments of the iP. While the tags appear in my list of tags and I have merged my branches, the dashboard does not seem to list my branches as part of iP Admin? 

<img width="861" height="135" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79c88e31-e8e2-4763-9838-e06ab696f1fe" />
This is my dashboard (at this point I have completed A-CodingStandard and A-JavaDoc, but not Level-9).

<img width="554" height="138" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be734e3a-cafa-49b2-86d7-13138e40f845" />
The listed branches show that I have merged the branches onto master.

Perhaps it is the sequence of commands I performed in order to push my code onto my fork? This is what I do usually:
1. On branch-A-CodingStandard, `git add .`
2. `git commit`
3. <enter commit message here>
4. `git tag A-CodingStandard`
5. `git push --set-upstream origin branch-A-CodingStandard `(to push the local branch onto the remote server)
6. `git push origin A-CodingStandard`
7. `git checkout master`
8. `git merge --no-ff branch-A-CodingStandard -m "Merge branch "branch-A-CodingStandard" into master"`

I greatly apologise if this issue has been resolved or repeated, as I wasn't able to locate it. If a solution exists, it would be greatly appreciated if I could be redirected to the existing solution! If not, I appreciate any help I can get :)

Thanks @jvvvstin for the fixes!! I appreciate the help and I will definitely get to trying out the fix. I've worked on a few other things while this issue was open, so unless I want to dig a bit deeper into the commits to ensure the tag is tagged to the correct commit (ie `HEAD~2` may not be accurate in my case), I might keep it as is. 

That said, I'll probably try it out for a future commit, to drill the practice into habit. Thank you to @damithc as well for the response :)

**1. :fas-info-circle: Level of severity for documention bug caused by incomplete documentation in User Guide**
</div>

If from reading the User Guide, I am unable to understand what the function of a particular command is, what severity should this documentation bug be considered? The command is not integral to the functionality of the program, but it is a genuine feature that is not clearly explained.

Would it be a:
1. severity.Low : Because it is not core to the program, i.e. I can still continue to use the program / test out the feature myself to see what it does
2. severity.Medium : It deters users from using a potentially helpful feature of the program (users may not want to run a command they don't understand as no "undo" feature is provided)

I'm aware that an enum class should be named like any other class with PascalCase, but is there any rule for the enum members themselves? It would be more convenient for my code if I had everything be lower case atm.

After some thought I think I agree with the general consensus that enum members should be in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE since they are pretty much treated as static final constants. Thanks everyone for the responses!

I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to reveal any information about the team I am bug testing for. I think all I can say is that it is not a major feature of the program, like it is still usable even without that command.

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡Automatically format code to obey checkstyle rules**
</div>

Using the [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) formatter, you can configure formatting rules to obey the checkstyle rules. You can also make it run as a pre-commit hook so that your code gets automatically formatted before committing any changes. This ensures consistency in the codebase and can reduce merge conflicts and noise in git diffs.

First, add the spotless plugin to your `build.gradle` along with these settings
```
plugins ``{``
    ...
    id("com.diffplug.spotless") version "7.2.1"
``}``
...
spotless ``{``
  java ``{``
    cleanthat()
    eclipse().configFile("./config/eclipse-formatter.xml")
    importOrder("java.", "javax.", "org.", "com.", "")
    removeUnusedImports()
    formatAnnotations()
    trimTrailingWhitespace()
  ``}``
``}``
```
Next, create the file `./config/eclipse-formatter.xml` and add these formatting rules:
```

```

As stated in #366, there is a checkstyle rule that erroneously flags lambda declarations, go to `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml` and delete these lines (around line 338 iirc):
```
<module name="SeparatorWrap">
  &gt;!-- Checks that the ",", "]", "[", "...", ";", "(" is at the previous end of line in a line wrap. -->
  <property name="tokens" value="COMMA, RBRACK, ARRAY_DECLARATOR, ELLIPSIS, SEMI, LPAREN"/>
  <property name="option" value="eol"/>
</module>
```

Now whenever you run `./gradlew spotlessApply`, it will apply all these formatting rules, run `./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` to double check that it covered all the checkstyle rules. To add this as a pre-commit hook so that spotless runs before you commit any changes, create a new file at `.git/hooks/pre-commit` with these contents:
```
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running spotlessApply..."
gradle spotlessApply

git add -u

exit 0
```
Note that everyone in the team must add this locally if they want the pre-commit hook

Do update this thread if the formatting rules does not cover any checkstyle rules, leave a link to a branch where it fails and I will try to add new formatting rules to fix it.

**3. :fas-info-circle: checkstyle.xml SeparatorWrap module erroneously flags lambdas**
</div>

While trying to set up a formatter to obey the checkstyle rules, I ran into this checkstyle error that I could not fix with my formatter
'''
[ant:checkstyle] [ERROR] /home/user/programming/tp/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java:94:17: '(' should be on the previous line. [SeparatorWrap]
'''

Here is the code snippet triggering the error
'''java
@Test
public void parseCommand_unrecognisedInput_throwsParseException() ``{``
    assertThrows(ParseException.class, String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, HelpCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE),
            () -&gt; parser.parseCommand(""));
``}``
'''

At first I thought that it was complaining that the paranthesis for the lambda declaration is not on the previous line, and it expected the code to be like this:
'''java
@Test
public void parseCommand_unrecognisedInput_throwsParseException() ``{``
    assertThrows(ParseException.class, String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, HelpCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE), ()
            -&gt; parser.parseCommand(""));
``}``
'''
Indeed this no longer produces any checkstyle errors, but there was no rule in my formatter to force lambda declarations to behave this way. I looked into the exact checkstyle module for this rule:
'''
 &lt;module name="SeparatorWrap">
  &lt;!-- Checks that the ",", "]", "[", "...", ";", "(" is at the previous end of line in a line wrap. -->
  &lt;property name="tokens" value="COMMA, RBRACK, ARRAY_DECLARATOR, ELLIPSIS, SEMI, LPAREN"/>
  &lt;property name="option" value="eol"/>
&lt;/module>
'''
It became clear that the purpose of this rule is to make sure separators like commas and parenthesis are placed at the correct positions when a single statement is broken up into multiple lines, so that code doesn't look like this:
'''
myMethod
(arg1
, arg2
, arg3);
'''
However, this also flags the left parenthesis of lambda declarations, even though it is common to have them at the start of the new line, just like in the first code snippet, and I also do not see anything in the coding standards about having lambdas on a new line. Is it fine to delete this checkstyle module, since my formatter will handle the cases it is trying to cover anyways?

It's probably more appropriate to use a 3rd party library (like [commons cli](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/)) to parse command line arguments rather than write a parser yourself, but this requires approval from prof.

> Yeah, I admit that I intend to do this mostly for didactic reasons; it isn't terribly difficult to write a simple recursive descent parser for the kinds of commands that are in scope for the tP. For other projects I'd agree, using a parser generator or an existing parsing solution is likely going to be better.

As an aside I feel like parsing commands as a grammar using recursive descent is overkill, I believe typical cli parsers are implemented as state machines like a lexer approach with regex

I've looked through the checkstyle docs and there doesn't seem to be a way to disable this, maybe its by intention to keep constructors simple? Any more complicated constructors could use a builder method.

@damithc In the Storage.java I use serialize technique to encode the data and I use a path "src/main/resources/data/rio.ser" to access the data file, saving and loading the data to/from it. So I think what happened here is that when i create a JAR file, the pathing is different so it cannot find the data file with the provided path. 
Also, I tried to ask AI or searched for it but I cannot find a way to know how the pathing works and if theres another way to access the data file from the code.

Guys, my peer help me figured it out. The data of the main project is different from the data of the JAR file so I have to use Path files to create a different data path for the JAR file itself in the build/libs directory. Thank you for your participation!
        this.path = Path.of("data/rio.ser");
        this.pathDir = Path.of(".").resolve(path.getParent()).resolve(path.getFileName());

Given that it does not have any fields or non-abstract methods, why use an abstract class. 

Lets say i want to add a field or a non-abstract method in the future, therefore my only choice is to edit this class. On the other hand, if i were to make this a interface, my implemented command class could implement the command interface and another abstract class/interface.

Would an interface not allow for more extensibility instead of modification(Open closed principle)?

**3. :fas-info-circle: Bug found during PE only occurs on Windows**
</div>



Hi @damithc and CS2103T teaching team, 

Would need some help here dealing with how to respond to a bug raised to us that somehow only occurs on Windows.

One of our features involves a separate window popping up. 

On MacOS (the OS our team uses to test our product, and to implement), all windows are always correctly sized and accessible.

However, on Windows, for some reason the window that pops up goes out of bounds on the screen, and it causes some problems for the PE tester that used Windows.

How do we handle such a case? I feel that it is quite unfair to mark us down given that this was an issue we spent time on to specifically fix, and after testing we (very reasonably) thought it was fixed, and submitted it in the release. 

This was also during the gap between PE-D and v1.6, so there was limited time and limited code changes allowed to begin with, and going out of my way to obtain multiple devices with multiple different operating systems just to test a change is highly impractical and should not be expected of students in my opinion.

Also, to get another student to extensively test our app (which is making them go out of their way as well to spend an excessive amount of time to comprehensively test all these small little features on another OS) also sounds impractical to me.

Furthermore, we were given multiple green lights by the automated smoke testing emails from the CS2103 team, which gave us another false sense of security that our app was working fine on other operating systems (I do understand that the automated smoke testing does not do any actual tests on the functionality, but rather I am trying to say that this lowered our guard to comprehensively go out of our way (as detailed above) to test on other operating systems)


This seems to me like a flaw of the Windows operating system itself, and we are having some issues with how to classify such a bug report. Would this still count as a bug? Or can we say that the bug is not reproducible (under our team's working conditions) under response.CannotReproduce?

Here are some of my screenshots from testing your app! If I were so bold and presumptuous to do so, may I ask kindly that you could possibly consider improving the UI of the app? It would look much more professional if you did so. Otherwise, the app feels really snappy and responsive; keep up the excellent work!

The existence of an Inbox class does not ontologically depend on the presence of messages. Both of them can exist indepedently of each other. 

Think of how your inbox does not disappear when you have no messages in your inbox. Hope this helps!

P.S. I don't exactly know either, why an email can have 0 bodies despite it having a composition relation with a message... if anyone could help that'd be great too!

My solution to this problem was to get rid of the /data folder (which contains the .txt file for local storage) each time the test finishes by adding:

'''bash
rmdir /s /q data 
'''
at the end of the runtest.bat file.

This allows you to continue testing your other features (apart from the save/load) in a predictable manner.

With week 7's introduction of a fork-based team development workflow, I was wondering if the following TDD-driven approach would be appropriate.

1. Person A picks up a feature F1 to work on
2. Person B writes the test cases for F1, and submits a PR to the main repo
3. Person A and C review person B's test cases and merges them with main repo
4. Person A creates the feature that has to adhere to the tests created and submits a PR
5. PR is reviewed by B and C before being accepted

Would this workflow be appropriate or practical to implement? For anyone with TDD or fork-based development experience, what challenges do you think we would face, and overall do you think this is recommended? Any feedback or discussions are welcome in this thread, thank you!

Some images to show what you mean would help, but perhaps you have a linter installed that automatically reformats any changes to your text? Or if you are using text blocks """, they tend to take any whitespaces such as spaces or newlines as they are, which could be affecting your text files

After more research, I think the issue is because the compile command no longer works on the non-flat hierarchy of my .java source files, so the compile command in runtest.bat would not work with nested packages without more complex scripting or build tools. I'll revisit this again and close this issue soon.

May I clarify about the above?

If the tester classifies that the bug is of medium severity, but we do not think it is a bug and reject the bug. Would the teaching team only accept Medium severity or Not a bug as the final state?

Would this be considered wrong or different, although the logo looks the same?
I searched that it could matter with spacing or lining when drawing logo, but it keeps returning to flagged state although I tried comparing files and fix it.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on severity level — possible violation of Tp Constraint-Single-User (up for discussion)**
</div>

Dear all,

I would like to seek advice on determining the appropriate severity level for a potential bug related to the Constraint-Single-User requirement.

The team’s product appears to allow the sharing of user profiles across multiple users, as implied by the following user story and some functionalities in the system also point to this being a platform where multiple users work on together:

“As a student, I want to add my own skills to my profile so that others can discover me for team formation.”

<img width="612" height="75" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18f461cf-52b3-413f-a55e-33c48d145034" />

This design suggests that each user’s data is visible to others using the same application instance, effectively making it a multi-user system rather than a single-user tool.

According to the module specification, there is a requirement for the tp project to have a single-user constraint:

<img width="507" height="109" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e741d99-804f-41cf-a734-3b1d7e80c79c" />

Given this, may I clarify:

Whether this constitutes a violation of the project constraint and is a bug, and

If so, what severity level would be appropriate — for instance, would it be considered a severity.High or severity.Medium feature flaw, since it affects the fundamental system design and purpose (i.e., deviates from the prescribed project scope)?

Any inputs would be much appreciated.

I tested the program on my Mac and it runs smoothly, great job!  I especially like the clean and intuitive UI: it makes the experience really pleasant.
One suggestion: you might want to refine the error messages. Right now, they feel a little too generic, so users may not immediately know how to correct their mistakes when an invalid command is entered. More specific guidance (e.g. hinting at valid formats or expected inputs) could make the tool even more user-friendly.

Overall, it’s an excellent piece of work, well done!

The program works on my Mac. Every command listed to test seems to be working fine, and I am impressed by the free command.  One possible improvement: consider adding a check for cases where an event’s start time is later than its end time, raising a clear error in that scenario could help prevent invalid event entries. Overall, excellent work.

I really like how clear the error messages are regarding date formats, and the UI looks fantastic. One possible improvement would be to catch the case where an event’s start date comes after its end date, and raise a more specific exception for it.
Overall, excellent work and I’d be happy to test again once you’ve made the changes :)

**2. :fas-info-circle: My jar file can run under java 22 rather than java 17**
</div>


I have both Java 22 and Java 17 on my laptop, and it's sometimes confusing about which is used to compile the files. I used VSCode for all my stuff, and my Gradle works perfectly fine, as I have ensured that my path configuration sticks to JDK 17.  However, when I create the jar file from gradlew and try to do a smoke test. It shows the following exception, suggesting that I am using Java 22 to compile the jar file. It works fine when I try to run the jar with Java 22 instead.
My question is:
Whether it causes any troubles in the actual grading process if it runs on Java 22 instead of 17?
If so, can you make sure that everything stays under Java 17 with VSCode?

```

My opinion: I suspect that Address Book 3 might have a glitch on its logging config. It cannot resolve a file path that contains space. 

Evidence: The original file path is "C:\Program Files\AddressBook3" which contains a space, and the new path "C:\AddressBook3" do not have a space. Nothing else has changed.

> [@CYW2004](https://github.com/CYW2004) Also try `C:\AddressBook3\foo bar` folder. If that doesn't work either, space in the folder path is likely the problem. Otherwise, `C:\Program Files` could be the problem (e.g., given it is a folder used by the OS, it might have stricter access control that doesn't allow AB3 to create files/folders inside it).

Thanks for the advice, I created a 'foo bar' folder and it opens AB3 correctly. 

Therefore I should correct my conjecture: it is not a 'folder path space' problem.

If there is a code like: 
```
try ``{``
    // do something
``}`` catch (catch nothing) ``{``
    // do nothing
``}`` finally ``{``
    // do something else
``}``
```
In my opinion, catching is used for spotting runtime errors. If we catch nothing, this code is essentially the same as:
```
// do something
// do something else
```
So, back to the question, I do not think it conflicts any coding standard. But this would downgrade the simplicity and readability of code, as it uses a redundant logic structure.

For the first question should be correct as it is temporary.

For the second question, I think it depends on navigability to know who has who. If no navigability maybe you can't confirm.

May I ask why the Activity objects have association with navigability towards the UiWidget object? From the code for Activity, I don't see any direct association between it and UiWidget.

Just to clarify in an object diagram we can show association, navigability, roles/labels, dependency, composition, aggregation but not inherit/implement as those are class concepts. Are there anything else that can be shown in object diagram?

**1. :fas-info-circle: CI tests failing for Ubuntu but pass on Mac Locally**
</div>

I am currently working on a mac intellij Runtime version: 21.0.7+9-b631.52 aarch64
java version: 
openjdk version "17.0.14" 2025-01-21 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.56+15-CA (build 17.0.14+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu17.56+15-CA (build 17.0.14+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)

After making changes to the main code and tests I am able to pass all junit tests and build the application successfully. 

However when i push the code to github, three test cases fail for ubuntu.

Does anyone know why this is the case?

Hi im testing on macos.

Most of the commands work as expected. However there appears to be an issue with the error handling, when the wrong format for a deadline task was input to the application, there was no proper error handling and the application simply did not allow the text to be sent. Perhaps the application should return an error message with the proper format using a date format parser because this issue happens for event tasks as well.


<img width="842" height="335" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c1c4628-c8bb-42db-92f8-72d2b74b649f" />

There is also some issue with the resizing of the window, but im not sure if this is necessary to resolve for the ip. Other than that the data is saved when sanbot exits and is properly loaded when the sanbot runs again. Good job.

* Background
    * I am using MacOS and using IntelliJ version: 21.0.6+9-b631.42 aarch64 (JCEF 122.1.9), and running Java version: openjdk version "17.0.14" 2025-01-21 LTS

* Instructions followed 
    * Referring to the 'Updating documents' section in this [article](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html)

    * I clicked on the guide for [macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) and used chruby to install ruby version 3.4.6 (I googled the latest stable version of ruby)
    * I ran the commands and restarted my terminal before verifying the version of ruby
    * I installed jekyll

@damithc Prof, is it possible to update the "bundled with" version from 2.1.4 to something more modern like 2.7? 

e.g in the Gemfile.lock

```
 BUNDLED WITH
   2.1.4
```

Adding on to kahei's point, Class A & B have an association relationship as Class A 'has a' Consumer&lt;List&lt;Class B>> field and therefore holds references to Class B instances. Class A can 'use' the Consumer to perform an action (implemented by the Consumer) on the List&lt;Class B>. Hence, Class A would not depend on Class B as it does not invoke any of Class B's methods. Instead, Class A would have a dependency relationship with the Consumer.

Try renaming the package and main class path consistently. (standardise lowercase)

I had a similar error when I first ran my code. If you copied over code from the duke javafx project, double check your file paths in Main.

Short answer, I wouldn't think so.

The clear command works as intended. Based on the User Guide, its functionality is to clear all stored data and the implementation does exactly that.

Thus, this would not be classified as a bug but could have taken as a potential usability limitation/issue as such a destructive command without a confirmation may be risky.

I’m working on Task A-Exceptions and I had a couple of questions:

1. Does anyone have a simple example of a custom exception class (like DukeException) that you used in your project? A very short example or part works, I’d love to see how you structured it and where you used it.

2. Also, I’m wondering — what’s the actual benefit of creating a custom exception class if it just extends Exception and uses super(message)? Couldn’t we just use if-else for most error handling?

3. Lastly, if I handle at least 2 exceptions using try-catch blocks but use if-else for the rest, would I still be penalized? Or is the goal just to show that we understand how to use exceptions properly?

**1. :fas-info-circle: UML: Is it mandatory for ref frames to have an existing, corresponding, sequence diagram?**
</div>

Quoting from the Week 8 Sequence Diagrams topic:

> Reference frames help you to break complicated sequence diagrams into multiple parts or simply to **omit details you are not interested in showing.**

(emphasis mine)
Not too sure if it's just me, but from the phrasing it *seems* like it's possible to create ref frames for the sake of omitting irrelevant information. If we do this, **must** we have a separate & corresponding sequence diagram?

In my case, I would like to "ref-out" a certain part of a sequence diagram because very similar steps have been shown before. Specifically, our documentation has shown how a parser creates an `edit` command. I now want to create a sequence diagram that involves creating a different command. The different command has very different behaviour on calling `execute()` - but the parsing of the command is basically the same. Must I show the steps to parsing the command? Can I just create a generic `ref` block?

Hopefully this question makes sense, thanks in advance!

The install section of the page tells the user to use `sudo pacman -Syu gitmastery-bin` to install, but this does not work, as gitmastery is not in the [official Arch repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&arch=any&arch=x86_64&repo=Core&repo=Core-Testing&repo=Extra&repo=Extra-Testing&repo=Gnome-Unstable&repo=KDE-Unstable&repo=Multilib&repo=Multilib-Testing&repo=Testing&q=gitmastery-bin&maintainer=&flagged=):

It is in the [arch user repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gitmastery), but installing it with yay does not work. 

<img width="747" height="64" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/419feb9f-8e75-4839-a545-c583fc61517c" />

The issue is related to the PKGBUILD file. There seem to be typos, many references to $srdir but that variable does not exist, so it looks for the file in the root directory / instead. By replacing all $srdir with $srcdir, the installation works fine.

<img width="821" height="46" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abf7e81d-5af6-46f5-ac63-6ed0e9b94404" />

## Overall steps to install gitmastery on arch
If you want to reproduce what I did:
1. Go to the [AUR page for gitmastery-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gitmastery-bin)
2. Clone the URL from the page (https://aur.archlinux.org/gitmastery-bin.git)
3. `cd` into directory
4.  Open up PKGBUILD and replace all instances of $srbuild with $srcbuild. I did this with vim, with `%s/srdir/srcdir/g`
5. Install with `makepkg -si`
6. Done

@woojiahao Yep, the fix works! I can install it with the AUR helper yay. 

Just to clarify, it does show up on the AUR but AUR is not the repository that pacman uses. To install packages from AUR, Arch maintains that you either build it yourself or use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers), like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay). Pacman uses another, "official" repository.

Either way, thank you for the quick fix and for maintaining a version on Arch! I read the notion post on the linux packaging for git mastery and it was quite interesting. 

As for the install instructions on the course website, I think you should just redirect arch users to the AUR page directly and ask them to build it or use an AUR helper to install it. Wonder if any other students with arch can chime in...

To add on to @gnahuy123,

My mental model is that event-driven architecture is very much related to listeners and handlers that are quite common in GUIs/Webdev. So something like `button.listen(() -&gt; ``{``doThis()``}``` falls under event-driven because we attach a handler that transmits messages to other components once an event occurs.

While transaction processing is more related to say, [load balancing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-load-balancing/). If you're unfamiliar with the concept you can read the link, but TL;DR it's where instead of sending requests directly to specific servers, you mediate requests with a server in the middle (the dispatcher). The dispatcher decides which server to send the request to based on metrics like server health, load, etc.

So I think the dispatcher in transaction-processing systems are inherently "heavier" - they include some sort of inherent logic to dynamically choose where the event goes. In contrast to event-driven dispatchers, which simply send messages to some predefined consumer. And yea, the dispatcher in transaction-processing systems get sent events directly by some actor, while in event-driven architectures the dispatcher directly attaches to the relevant section to get the events.

Not too sure if everything I said here is correct, so any clarifications would be welcome haha.

I think you miscategorized this as MVC! You're looking at the observer pattern.

Most likely the UI classes here already have some mechanism to get the student list. It could be that they hold a copied  student list, so any changes in the original student list does not propagate to the UI directly. The update() method here is like a signal to the UI classes to "refresh" their view and obtain a new student list.

Another method that is possible (but not shown directly in the example here) is to have the update() method accept a student list as a parameter. This allows the UI classes to directly replace their view of student list on an update.

I think the key thing that you should be grasping from this is that the observer pattern allows a class to be notified immediately whenever another object goes through some change. What the listener does with this notification is implementation-level detail that can differ based on the use case.

I highly recommend reading [this article on refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)

On my end, those two URLs also do not resolve to a valid site.

According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1181888/what-does-xmlns-in-xml-mean:

> The actual namespace itself, often a [IRI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier), is of no real consequence. It should be unique, so people tend to choose a IRI/URI that they own, but it has no greater meaning than that. Sometimes people will place the schema (definition) for the XML at the specified IRI, but that is a convention of some people only.

To my understanding, it seems like you can ignore the external resource safely, as only serves as a unique namespace.

Hello teaching team, upon further checking, I realised that I merely checked my local git repository and forgot to check my remote repository on github. I see that I had forgotten to push to remote, and have just done so.
Would this IP weekly progress then retroactively update to account for the commits I had just pushed?

I did not realize that the remote hadn't been updated, because I had been checking these tags here:

In the example given for IP task, ui was responsible for printing out all strings required for user interface which is how I implemented mine. However, Junit testing requires String for testing.

yes, i also did the same thing as @jlismee where i threw an exception with an error message to only accept known commands to be able to add task inside the tasklist. But you could also define your own set of commands too!

@subhitsha-sp I think Level-7 also requires to - Load the data from the hard disk when the chatbot starts up - which means when you start the application, you might need to load the data from your .txt file to your current tasklist. What I did was to have a method that uses a file reader to read the contents of the .txt file - so as long as there is data stored in your .txt file, it will sync to be up to date with your tasklist and you can always verify by testing out with "list" for your subsequent iterations

I think its because in the class diagram, we can see that there is an association from the Activity class to Watcher interface, as in the code, there is an array of Watcher Objects stored, with the navigability towards Watcher class

The question mentions to - Sketch an object diagram that has two Activity objects a1 and a2, both being watched by a UiWidget
object u.

Object u is essentially a Watcher object due to type compatability and so the 2 activity objects can have an association with object u. 

In Object diagrams, dependencies are not shown, like in the example below. As for inheritance/implementation, although 2 classes are involved, it should be shown as 1 object

Hi! Eveything works well other than the bye command execution. The time between hitting enter and the exit of the program is too short to read all those ending remarks. Consider either giving more time for reading, shortening the remark, or prompt the user to click the cross themselves instead of auto close. But good work on all that animation!

Could I clarify what this means? What will happen to the severity of a bug whose duplicate status was rejected? Will it inherit another bug's severity (which the instructions above seem to suggest ie.

Hi @CATISNOTSODIUM, I firstly want to say that your user interface is really good, I appreciate you listing the valid commands, which makes it easier to figure out quickly what your chatbot can be used for and how to use its different functions.. Your tasks being added to the calendar is also very useful, as it allows users to easily see their tasks sorted by time.
One issue that bugged me a bit is the strictness of the date format, which is slightly not user-friendly, but I feel that that is honestly a minor issue. I tried to add time in 24 hours to the events also but it did not work, although I am not sure if that is because I was doing it wrongly or because I can only input dates.
The other issue is with the bye command, which for some reason, on macOS, (15.6 (24G84)) causes the unexpected quitting error.
Overall, a great chatbot, and it was a pleasure to smoke test it! I also appreciate your detailed instructions on how to smoke test.

The actual answer only declares line 2 as an answer and not line 4, so I think you are supposed to only give the declaration, because that is where the standard is violated, and not elsewhere, where the variable that was declared previously is simply being used.

What went well: 
- Nice UI :)
- For **WINDOWS**, it handles cases where the storage file does not exist. Verifies correct behavior for saving and loading tasks.
- list: Run list to ensure all tasks are displayed with correct formatting.
- todo: Add a simple task like todo smoke test and verify it's listed correctly. Also test handling of undersupplied arguments.

- event: Use event cs2103T tut /from 2025-12-12 /to 2025-12-13 and verify it's listed correctly. Test handling of undersupplied arguments and incorrect formatting.
- delete: Remove a task by index and confirm it has been deleted.
- mark/unmark: Toggle completion status using mark 1 and unmark 1.
- find: Try find quiz and verify that it returns the correct matching tasks. Confirm it handles partial matches.

- contacts: Run contacts to ensure all contacts are displayed with correct formatting.
- deletec: Remove a contact by index and confirm it has been deleted.

What went wrong:
- For **LINUX**, it does not handle cases where the storage file does not exist
- findc: Fails to find the correct contact using queries like findc +65 or findc +6512345678

@damithc I have seen the issue from your response, the first line of code given in the tour is creating a new file colours.txt which is different from the colors.txt given in the things repo given before, this is why the committing failed for B1. The author might have to fix the naming if it is referencing the same file from the 'things' repo. Thank you.

# Context
* System: Macbook(M3)
* Java version: java azul zulu 17.0.14

# Issue
I run `./gradlew build` in terminal and it will sometimes build successfully and sometimes fail because 5 test cases fail. I have tried to push this PR to GitHub when it succeeded but it fails the codecov checks:
<img width="243" height="29" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30fe7547-fc02-4ccf-86fd-b2064c7e0684" />

# What I have tried
* I have tried using the debugger to trace the data by running the test methods individually
  * All the data is correct and the behaviour is as expected
*  I have tried using the debugger to trace the data by running the whole test file to check for test leak
  * All data is correct and the behaviour is as expected
* I tried giving the error message and the context to Gemini Pro, ChatGPT 5 and result suggested that it was either test leak(checked) or mismatch in Gradle and JUnit versions
  * JUnit version: 5.4.0
  * It's the same in IntelliJ and in the build.gradle file
* I have tried running the following flags:
  * `./gradlew build --scan`
    * Not very helpful
  * `./gradlew build --stacktrace`
    * Made the build successful for a while, but running `./gradlew build` after about 5min resulted in build failure again
  * `./gradlew build --info`
    * also results in build success

Has anyone experienced a similar issue and fixed it?

I understand the possibility of a state leak. And to address that i tried to use the `@BeforeEach` annotation to a method `setUp()` which reinitialises and instantiates the dependent model. Is it possible that it could still leak?

Tests have been added back in. Changing most of the static variables in my TypicalData files into getters that return copies instead of the actual static object fixed it.

Sorry to be clearer let me reiterate my points. The resched cmd has 2 versions.

1. (version 1) resched must be strictly in the format of _YYYY-MM-DD_ if you want to call the [_resched &lt;instruction_idx> YYYY-MM-DD_]. This version allows for the rescheduling to an earlier date if the user inputs an earlier date.
 
2. (version 2) resched can also be called in the form of _+numberOfDays (i.e. +3d, +6d etc.)_. In full, this would look like _[resched  &lt;instruction_idx> +3d]_. For this, you can only call + (plus) and not - (minus). I have realised this is somewhat of a limitation/loophole but the focus of this comment for now will just to make sure my chatbox can run on Windows/Linux OS', and not so much on the feature itself.

Thanks everybody. Hopeful for a Linux OS follow up soon.

The above image shows that one-shot commands are preferred over multi-step commands, from notes in Week 3. 

Suppose there are duplicate names, and we use names as a key to delete/edit a contact, is it still recommended to have one-shot commands? For instance, delete Alroy, but there are 2 Alroys in the address book, can the application ask the user to choose one among the 2?

Thank you in advance! 😄

Hi, I would like to check if there's any issue if the latest tagged release is not displayed right at the top of the releases page. Link to release page -&gt; https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/releases

As shown in the image, the second release in the page is actually the latest release, as our team had to make some minor adjustments after the initial v1.6 release. We proceeded to name this second release v1.6b as suggested by the cs2103t website.

**3. :fas-info-circle: Drive permissions when running JAR file**
</div>

HI, while testing my JAR file in an isolated folder, I've noticed that the data folder and empty data file is correctly created as expected when running for the first time from a folder in my C:\ drive, but is unable to be created when the folder is in the D:\ drive (this requires restarting PowerShell as an administrator before it works), which I assume is due to the D:\ drive having stricter permissions.

My question is - is this considered sufficient for  dealing with hard-coded paths, or would I need to make it such that the JAR file works in both drives without having to launch as an administrator (if this is even possible)? Thank you!

It essentially mean that CCD serves the same function as class diagram in domain modelling (as the implementation detail is not important). Then out of these 2, CCD is preferred over class diagram at the domain modelling level, thus not needed.

Given that said, if CCD is not in the options, the answer should be none.

process() is inherited from Foo. If we go back to the definition of inheritance, we are duplicating the behavior and attributes of the superclass into the subclass. Which means there is an implicit process() from Foo if Bar class does not override it

i agree with @jvvvstin. create() is called by run() hence the arrow should be to Factory and not to Unit. Also, i think its not Unit that calls increase() its the run() that calls the increase function.

To remove the folder from the remote repo but still keep it locally, you can do the following:
1. Add the folder to your `.gitignore` file. For example, add the line `/imgs`.
2. Untrack the files that are already in the repo (make sure you've committed everything else beforehand):
'''bash
git rm -rf --cached .
git add .
'''
This removes all files from the repository and adds them back (this time respecting the rules in your `.gitignore`).

3. Commit and push your changes. After that, the `imgs` folder will no longer appear in the remote repository, but it will remain in your local copy.

I also encountered the same issue as you. Here is what I did:
- Added a flag to the program. I called it `--fresh`. This tells the program to start fresh, without loading memory. This allows for my UI tests to be predictable every time.
- I chose to test my save/load functionality using JUnit. Basically, I create a list of tasks, save it, load it and make sure the loaded tasks exactly matches the one that I created.
- I am maintaining both ways of testing for now. text-ui-test is excellent at testing expected UI outputs from the program, but cannot test the smaller functionalities/logic. On the other hand, JUnit is awesome at testing said logic but is cumbersome when utilised to test the UI outputs from the program.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on lower team sizes impact on marks**
</div>



For teams with lower / bigger sizes (e.g. 4 team members), and we feel that the bug was an equal responsibility shared by all members, would we technically be (individually) penalised more than the same situation with 5 members?
Since there are 4 assignees instead of 5 assignees.

<img width="981" height="111" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6da1f1-3b93-46db-a7bd-2b9709c301dd" />

e.g. if the penalty for the bug was `-1`, then a 4-man team individually would bear `-0.25`, whereas a 5-man team individually would bear `-0.2`.

Or will the penalty for such a bug be scaled according to the team size?
i.e. penalty for the aforementioned bug would be scaled to `-0.8`, then the 4-man team individually would bear `-0.2`.

**2. :fas-info-circle: LoC for Feature Freeze**
</div>



Apologies if it seems like a dumb question.

The example below states `Suppose you currently have 600 LoC under your name`.
Does this LoC refer to the functional code LoC only, or total LoC (inclusive of docs, others, functional-code, test-code)?
The [Q0] and [Q1] section do not elaborate on this and only state `LoC`.

This confusion stems from the below line in red for `10% [...] of the functional code`.

If `StudentList` is immutable, then as Harjun mentioned, the instance can be passed as a parameter to its `observerList` by using `update(StudentList newList)`.
It would be dangerous to pass a mutable reference of StudentList to random Observers.

Alternatively, the Observers could use their own way of communicating with the StudentList to retrieve the updates, like through a facade for the Model.
For the below example which doesn't use a facade (from MVC in textbook), instead of the `getData(id)` being called on StudentList, it could be the UI calling `getStudentData(id)` on the Model facade.
This allows the UI to not have a reference to `studentList`, but still be able to get updates from the new list.
Another design pattern to fix the flaw of mixing 2 design patterns.

so this behaviour has been specified, i think its just of inconvenience and doesnt fit well given description tutors need for their tutees may be lenghthier?

so i think it is a feature flaw more than a functionality flaw, just not sure if it is valid haha

I decided to separate the commands from the parser. While it’s possible to keep the commands inside the parser for the sake of encapsulation, this approach doesn’t scale well. As the number of commands grows, managing them all in a single script can quickly become messy and difficult to maintain.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Major rewriting/refactoring of existing components**
</div>

Is it considered within the scope of the tP to rewrite/refactor entire components?

To clarify, this is not about changing the overarching structure and architecture of the application. Things like the MVC architecture would be kept intact, and most of the abstraction boundaries around the rewritten/refactored components (e.g. the component interfaces) too will be kept intact. The goal here of rewriting/refactoring is not to change the overarching architecture, but to make existing components less coupled, better abstracted, and more performant.

I would assume this is not against tP grading rules, but would like to get some confirmation since it seems there isn't much detail about this in the tP grading page.

- - -

Some background information, if it helps:

I am particularly asking about rewriting the parsing component to make it easier to add new commands and add more flexibility in command structure. The current parser uses very inextensible syntax and follows very inefficient parsing techniques that involve scanning the same string over and over again. I would like to rewrite the parser and get it to use more well-established techniques (with better theoretical grounds) than the present implementation.

Seems like you staged the file, but never committed it. I'm inferring it from the `new file: &lt;filename>` line after you typed `git status`.

My understanding is:
- Use `git rm` to stage deletion (and remove it from your working directory) if you have previously committed a file (file is presently being tracked) and would like to now delete it and stop tracking the file.
- If you have not previously committed a file, then `git rm` is a dangerous command because it deletes the file from your working directory as well, and deleting the file means git cannot retrieve the lost file for you since it has not previously saved any version of that file. The `-f` flag overrides this warning and forces removal.

If you had committed those files previously, then git would likely have let the commands you were having trouble with run and restore the files for you. The nice thing about git is that it often gives you the commands you need to type or the exact parts you need to fix. If you wanted to unstage the added file but keep the file in your working directory (safe for a file that has not yet been committed prior to this), doing `git restore --staged &lt;filename>` or `git rm --cached &lt;filename>` would've done the trick, as suggested by git.

The latter errors (`fatal: could not resolve HEAD`) are likely due to your repository not having an initial commit. HEAD presently doesn't point to any commit.

I assume your intent is that you want to push local changes forcefully and overwrite what is on the remote. If you are sure that what you have locally is what you want reflected on the remote `master` branch and you do not care anymore about the commits on the remote that will be overwritten (probably whatever you were trying to get rid of by running `git reset`), then run `git push -f origin master` (add the `-f` flag to force push).

Yeah, I admit that I intend to do this mostly for didactic reasons; it isn't terribly difficult to write a simple recursive descent parser for the kinds of commands that are in scope for the tP. For other projects I'd agree, using a parser generator or an existing parsing solution is likely going to be better.

> As an aside I feel like parsing commands as a grammar using recursive descent is overkill, I believe typical cli parsers are implemented as state machines like a lexer approach with regex

Some of our planned features (even if they are only low priority) depend on the grammar being sufficiently expressive (at least context-free/type-2). Nested brackets, for example, cannot be expressed in regular grammars, so DFAs/NFAs/regexes are insufficient.

Might be veering off topic already, but there are also other practical considerations that went into this (but part of why I am doing this to begin with is also to figure out what necessitates stronger parsers), like the ability to construct detailed error messages and the ability to easily prove correctness of the parser in implementing a particular grammar.

I do have both a lexer and parser ready from the iP, and after implementing them, I wouldn't say using recursive descent is overkill or requires significantly more effort than implementing a DFA/NFA, but it does let me, say, write more detailed error messages (to do that, the machine needs to 'remember' what production rule it was trying to apply).

> You may refactor tP code and change the design as you see fit, provided you do it incrementally. So, it should be fine to replace the parser with a different implementation.

Great! Thanks for the clarification.

Hi @psh12320 , thank you for the reply. I got the error after repeated keying in multiple wrong commands e.g. 'test'. But i think this error is likely due to a rendering issue in javafx as i stopped facing it after changing out the image to a different one. Thank you for the help and in spotting another mistake that I missed! 👍

@trekkie3 's comment seems reasonable. `chmod +x` should resolve the permission denied issue and make the script executable. The text-ui-test could also be removed instead since the GUI should be in use at this point in the iP, and text-ui-test itself is not needed anymore.

The composition relationship should be that `Handout` contains `Section(s)`, so the direction of the association should be from `Handout` to `Section`.  Judging by the `capacity(Handout h)` method, the dependency should be from `Section` to `Handout`? The direction of the dependency is different, so it should count as a separate thing to add, in my opinion.

most features working well.

suggestion: perhaps split error handling of incomplete commands so we know if message is missing or date / make the wording less confusing. 

general suggestion: when non command text is entered would be helpful for response message to mention what commands are there

if deadline or event command is run with non date input after the in line flags (/by, /from, /to) the message never gets sent.
every effort to send results in the following error in the terminal -

The message should instead go thorugh  and nina should give incorrect format prompt again. Perhaps you should give example format like /by yyyy-mm-dd rather than - "OOPS!!! Format: deadline <desc> /by <when>" in incorrect format message

also will be nice if you give different error messages by nina depending on whether it is the format of date that is the issue or the lack of a message in the command. Resizable window would make it better

general suggestion: when non command text is entered would be helpful for response message to mention what commands are there

Signing off, Godspeed !

**2. :fas-info-circle: $ gitmastery setup bash: gitmastery: command not found**
</div>

Hi,
Would appreciate some follow up steps to resolve the below issue if possible:

Gitmastery installation issue: 

$ gitmastery setup
bash: gitmastery: command not found

Steps taken so far:
1. Downloaded exe, ran from Downloads folder
3. Terminal pop up with some gitmastery info but couldnt type anything or ctrl D out, ended the terminal task from task manager
4. Added Downloads to PATH
5. Ran exe, terminal opened for a split second and some lines popped up but it auto closed before I could read anything.
6. From Downloads folder, gitmastery --help on Git Bash returned bash: gitmastery: command not found
7. Created folder Desktop/gitmastery-home, copied gitmastery.exe inside, added C:\Users\lohxi\Desktop\gitmastery-home to path. ran gitmastery.exe from C:\Users\lohxi\Desktop\gitmastery-home. cd to Desktop/gitmastery-home:
lohxi@XJ MINGW64 ~/Desktop/gitmastery-home
$ gitmastery setup
bash: gitmastery: command not found
$ gitmastery --help
bash: gitmastery: command not found

EDIT (12-08 0228): also tried running gitmastery.exe direct from Powershell and Git Bash terminals, both didn't work but returned different error messages

Never mind, resolved. 

User error.

I had mistakenly added the directory as a new system variable 'gitmastery', instead of editing the existing 'Path' system variable and adding a new line to it. 

I also should have run .\gitmastery.exe on Powershell and ./gitmastery.exe on Git Bash instead of gitmastery,exe directly. but after adding the gitmastery-home directory to Path properly it can run properly without prefixing with ./ or .\ anymore.

Sorry for the inconvenience!

If you used the HTTPS PAT method to setup your github auth, I dont think there will be any ssh keys created. Unless you were actually trying to setup and connect via SSH key instead. 

From what I understand from `https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/githubAuthentication.html` you can **EITHER** use HTTPS  **OR** SSH for authentication. So just following the instructions from either section should be sufficient to setup the authentication. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Personally, I think if you can run ```git clone https://github.com/se-edu/samplerepo-private.git``` another time and it doesn't ask for your credentials, you can assume that your credentials have been safely cached on your device and start working on the IP.

Additionally I agree with @Rah-Rah-Mitra that you can try using Github Desktop instead in the future as I've been using it for years with no issue. (though I don't know if using a GUI is encouraged by the course because you don't really learn the git commands that way :P )

You probably haven't added your jdk location to your system PATH, which is why your device is unable to run java commands like javac.

### To fix this you can try:
1. Make sure to **download a JDK**, the course requires us to use **JDK 17** so should have already downloaded it if you followed the course instructions. If you haven't you can go to the oracle website and download it. The compressed archive should be sufficient to my knowledge.
2. Move the JDK archive to your preferred location on your device, in my case I place it in a folder like this
<img width="697" height="162" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4338a11e-d87e-4dfe-b281-511932b54aac" />
 
3. **Add the location of your JDK compressed archive to your PATH**, similar to how you followed the instructions to setup the Github CLI
This resolved the issue for me.

In my case I also ran the windows installer to install JDK 17 on my device but this error didn't resolve until I updated my PATH with the compressed archive. If you try these steps and it still doesn't work you can try installing the JDK on your device as well and try to run the javac command again.

1. Here is an example of a custom exception that I have made
'''java 
public class UnknownCommandException extends BBongException ``{``
    public UnknownCommandException() ``{``
        super("Unknown Command! B. Bong doesn't know what to do...");
    ``}``
    public UnknownCommandException(String message) ``{``
        super(message);
    ``}``
``}``

//Main.java
public static Command stringToCommand(String word) throws UnknownCommandException ``{``
        for (Command c : Command.values()) ``{``
            if (c.getCommandWord().equalsIgnoreCase(word)) ``{``
                return c;
            ``}``
        ``}``
        throw new UnknownCommandException();
    ``}``
'''

2. Firstly, I agree with what @chuckyang123 mentioned that by defining your own exceptions and controlling where you throw them, it is easier to see what went wrong in your code if used appropriately. Secondly, if you look at my example, I can hard code custom error messages into my exceptions so that when I throw them I can just throw back the error message, making my code a little but shorter like this:
'''java
try ``{``
        command = Command.stringToCommand(commandParts[0].toLowerCase());
    ``}`` catch (UnknownCommandException e) ``{``
        botErrorMessage(e.getMessage());
    ``}``
'''
rather than doing something like:
'''java
try ``{`` 
    ...
``}`` catch (Exception e) ``{``
    System.out.println("Something went wrong");
``}``
'''
As you can see it kinda just saves me from writing a error message every time I catch my exception and just uses its hard coded value.

3. I personally think its fine to mix if-else and exception handling as at the end of the day its your own design choice for your code, I personally do mix both as I like keeping errors and exceptions managed at a certain level without them leaking out to the main code.

i first initialized a repo "branch-me" with main branch having no changes. which then i created a new branch "bug-fix" where my changes to the 2 functions are committed and pushed into. From the screenshot, I think I did it correctly.

However, when i run the following command:

```
git checkout main
gitmastery verify
```
it tells me that my main branch's functions have not been updated which is correct because the changes are in bug-fix, not main. Please advise.

> [@DJsudartha](https://github.com/DJsudartha) Can I check if you have setup Github using HTTPS or SSH? Also, what is the version of the app you are using? You can retrieve this information using `gitmastery version`

I used SSH for github connection, when calling gitmastery check github it also shows the following
```
 INFO  Checking that you have Github CLI is installed and configured
 INFO  Github CLI is installed
 INFO  You have authenticated Github CLI
 SUCCESS  Github CLI is installed and configured
```

I am currently using gitmastery v4.10.0

**2. :fas-info-circle: PE Tester Response: Do UML diagram variations count as cosmetic issue?**
</div>

Hello, I am trying to discern whether a UML diagram variation, such as the one provided in the week 10 tutorial exercise 3 can be counted as cosmetic? In particular, the UML diagram uses non-standard notation I and C to refer to interface and classes. 

For reference, this was the provided diagram in the tutorial:

<img width="1032" height="695" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed01aae5-846b-4a86-94d2-9d8fb2323aa6" />

The reasons why it is cosmetic are potentially that the notation explanations can be found in the plantUML website: https://plantuml.com/class-diagram that a reader could search up themselves.

However, the reasons against it being cosmetic are potentially that the diagram for the team I am reviewing also include an A symbol for abstract classes without labelling ```{``abstract``}``` and no `<<interface>>` label as well. This goes against 
the standard notation in the textbook. 

Example:
<img width="332" height="434" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3933a21-0c87-4716-b812-a297f32a87aa" />

@damithc Thanks prof for the explanation! For the issue I am reviewing, unfortunately I did not raise the point on inconsistent notations across the documentation although that would have been a great point! Instead, the issue was only raised for one particular diagram that used this notation, so I was wondering if this particular diagram notation on its own can be counted as a cosmetic issue?

Dependency means:
Class A uses Class B temporarily to perform some action.

Association class means:
A relationship between two classes that has its own data or behaviour.

A Student enrolls in a Course.
The relationship has attributes like grade, semester, etc.
So we model Enrollment as an association class.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Assumptions about testing environment**
</div>

Can we assume that the tester has both java and gradle installed on their device?

I don't use linux, so this question may be improperly phrased.
Since linux does not have a GUI, how do we ensure that our jar file is compatible with whatever GUI the linux user has?

Do we assume that the testing is done using x86 machines? 

Basically, what are the things that we assume the testing environment has when executing the jar file?

if i understand correctly, an association implies dependency (but not the other way round). In this case, since Class A contains a reference to Class B, it would be an association.

OS: Windows

Issues I have noticed:
- The READ ME says that SumTingWong recognises basic greetings like "good morning" and "what's up" which it does not seem to be able to do.
- The response to invalid commands is to enter "list", which returns a list of tasks and not any assistance with the commands.
- If the task list is empty, using commands like "list", "mark" and "unmark" will cause an error.

Other than these, I think the chatbot looks great! It works well for standard commands, and gives great feedback if you input the right command but wrong parameters. The different messages when you add a task to the list instead of just having a standard response is a nice touch too.

User guide link: https://catisnotsodium.github.io/ip/
Which OS'es to test on: **Mac and Linux (WSL is ok)**
## Things to check specifically:
Before testing, make sure that you delete `data/cattis.txt` from your machine before testing.
To start the application, simply run `java -jar cattis.jar`.
### File storage works properly
To test, place these instructions below line-by-line (except the text behind `//` which is used to indicate the expected behavior).
```
list // must show <empty>
todo task1 // task should have one element
mark 2 // should get out-of-bound
mark 1 // should work properly
list // must show one task
delete 1 
list // must show <empty>
bye
```

### Calendar view
Simply type `calendar` to check if there is no visual bugs. This includes 
- Misaligned or overlapping UI elements in the calendar grid
- Inconsistent color schemes or unreadable text
- Navigation buttons (e.g., <, >) not functioning properly

To apply some seed values, you can simply add some basic instructions.
```

Here is my GUI inspired by TokyoNight. (I tried my best to capture the vibe, but there's still a lot of room for improvements)
I feel like CSS is a lot more convenient to work with compared to using SceneBuilder style config alone.

Replying @naa-siuuuu-ff 
> One issue that bugged me a bit is the strictness of the date format, which is slightly not user-friendly, but I feel that that is honestly a minor issue. I tried to add time in 24 hours to the events also but it did not work, although I am not sure if that is because I was doing it wrongly or because I can only input dates.

Thank you for the feedback. I agree that the input format for date is too strict. If I had more time, I'd like to work on that further.

> The other issue is with the bye command, which for some reason, on macOS, (15.6 (24G84)) causes the unexpected quitting error.

I suspect that this will be an issue in macOS. I'm glad that you pointed that out.

Overall, thank you for smoke testing in macOS.

Using Intellij, Java 17, Windows 

Attempted to generate the fat JAR file for submission.

Upon selecting javaw, the popup will disappear and then appear again infinitely, and the JAR file will not open.

However, after moving the file into a test folder, and doing the following: 'open a terminal -&gt; navigate to the jar location -&gt; run the java -jar "JAR_FILE_NAME" command.', the JAR file is able to successfully run. 

'./gradlew run' also works fine from Intellij terminal.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**2. :fas-info-circle: Developer guide: Manual Testing**
</div>



By CS2103T, it was required that we document "Instructions for Manual Testing" in developer guide and that must "Cover all user-testable features but no need to cover existing AB3 features if you did not touch them.".

The team that I am bug finding did not write additional instructions for manual testing. They only updated the two manual testing previously in ab3 developer guide, 1. deleting a person (incomplete as they change the delete function in ab3 to allow two way of deleting a person, one by index and another by checking name and phone number which was not documented) and 2. saving data. 

They did not include manual testing for filter, find, sort function that they added. Personally, I am confuse on documenting this bug. Personally, I would definitely think this is a bug and that this bug is of high severity as it is a requirement from CS2103T side but was not fulfilled by the team. However, as the bug severity label guide given does not really cover this aspect, I am confuse in documenting this bug.

I have a question about use case portion in the developer guide. It is stated that "a use case is important if it involves a user interaction that is worthy of documenting". In the event that the application has filter by tag and find by name function and they quite similar, especially in terms of use case. The developer guide documented use case for find but not filter (was not mentioned at all, did not even mentioned how it is similar to find). Is that considered a bug?

Furthermore, another question on how do i judge the severity of bugs in developer guide? This is as bug severity guide given focus more on users using the application but developer guide main purpose is not for the user.

Regarding this for Wk 10, if there isn't significant change to the overall class diagrams or structure of the code, simply added functionality, can we instead opt to only update 1-2 UML diagrams and the rest focus on creating new UML diagrams like sequence diagrams that better reflect the new features?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Are we allowed to use APIs for the tP?**
</div>

I am not sure if this will affect the no remote server constraint. 

The API we plan to use is to convert an address or postal code into geopositional data to create a map view for the address book as well as check who is the closest person to someone else. 

The app will still be for a single user with APIs being used to enhance features.

For an unmarked task, running unmark __ then undo should leave it unmarked still. Similarly for marked tasked with mark __. 
Undoing other commands should work as expected.

I believe this is good practice to encapsulate it. Any command passed in will need to be parsed anyway, and thus hiding the command implementation inside of the parser file would reduce clutter with command classes when other programs are implementing the parser class.

I'm nitpicking and using an exaggerated example. Perhaps extra whitespaces in the middle and end of commands can be further handled.

Tested on Windows. All Commands work as intended. But you might want to catch the error of missing tasks instead of adding empty task into the last as shown in the screenshot. 
Other than that, well done no issues!

It should be dependency because Class B is used indirectly through the Consumer interface. Class A depends on Class B's existence for type safety, but doesn't have a direct structural relationship with it.

Hi, I'd like to clarify by what the scope is for bugs based on terminal outputs. In our course website, it states, 

<img width="715" height="265" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/662afd2e-58c8-42ba-a2a4-a31f46c40e0a" />

So, it is safe to assume that  100's of lines that was thrown due to 1 exception could 'worry' the user despite the UI operating normally?

If so, would it be appropriate to label it as
- Functionality bug
- Severy.low (because it doesn't impact the user)

Thanks for your time

### OS - MacOS Sonoma 14.5

### Remarks
Hi! Generally, most of the commands did run well but in the spirit of not repeating the points in some of the other comments, I'll be sharing issues/feedback that I personally faced.

<img width="417" height="624" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c964cc4-4495-42e6-a04c-f604c9f1c531" />

### Issues / feedback
- I don't believe the index out of bounds error was handled properly! (see image above)
- Difficult to read text because of low contrast difference between text color and background.

### Overall
I think the GUI is fun themed and it has a real techy vibe! No OS related issues and note the db file (taskSave.txt) was created in the same directory as the root of the .jar file.


### **Edit**

<img width="935" height="915" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1178ef53-75e1-4e40-9517-3e5d81395d78" />

I was closing my terminal when I suddenly saw all the warnings in the screenshot above. Not too sure why the warnings appeared but it did not impact functionality whatsoever. 

<img width="775" height="81" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b0f088b-70c1-4fc3-afee-7b02e6085bdc" />

If you'd like to debug or investigate, I've provided my java version details above!

@recursive-rc 

Thanks for replying! For more context

> Is such output common? For example, is this exception thrown everytime a commonly used command is run?

yes! Outputs every time a very common command is input! 

> Upon seeing this output, is a reasonable user likely to...
> ...think her previous command(s) was (were) unsuccessful?
> ...take some action to attempt to rectify the (perceived) error? If so, what is the effect of such actions?

I think that's really subjective but I'd definitely think something was wrong. 

> I'm admittedly not really sure about this. I think it might be severity.VeryLow since it's arguably cosmetic

I dont necessarily agree with this, as a cosmetic issue cab be as simple as a typo or not enough padding in the GUI. This issue, however, could result in the user stopping usage of the application in fear of, for example, accidentally deleting all the contacts (however unlikely). It is very difficult to predict what non technical users will think and behave like. 

But I think I'll still proceed with this bug. All exceptions shoudld be caught either ways.

Thanks!

Hi, my team would like to confirm whether we need to make sure that we push test code with feature code in the same PR? We would like to know if its fine if we just push test code in a separate PR at a later time.

We are concerned whether this is affect our tP grade, since we noticed that CodeCov would notify us that there isn't enough coverage. 

We find that this may slow down our velocity, since some features (even if not fully tested) are needed quickly since others depend on it.

Hi,

I saw on CourseReg that there is a tutorial bidding open for CS2103T. I was under the impression that the tutorials are supposed to be coupled with the session assigned for CS2101.

With that, I have two questions:
- Is my assumption true? (i.e. if I'm in SG19 for CS2101, I should be automatically assigned TG19 for the CS2103T tutorial)
- Otherwise, is it important for me to bid for the same tutorial as my CS2101 assignment?

What about this implementation? Will they now be in the same partition?

On this note, if we don't know the implementation of the function, should we assume separate paths as in @ZhuRong818 's example?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on bugs that occur outside of the software**
</div>

This bug is regarding the `export` feature, which allows the exporting of the application's data into a csv file. 

One of the reported bugs regarding this feature is that the user has to do some tweaks in Microsoft Excel itself in order for it to properly display some of the data. Specifically, non-english text has issues being displayed due to Excel not using UTF-8 encoding. 

However, the csv file itself (which is the main purpose of the `export` feature) works perfectly fine and is able to properly display all the data, either when viewed as a plain csv file or when opened using other applications such as Numbers (MacOS). 

How should we go about this bug report? Can it be considered under not in scope?

After we create an issue for a bug in the team repo's issue tracker and labelled it with the alpha-bug label, are we supposed to close the issue after addressing the bug? Last night I did just that, but the tP progress dashboard did not reflect any changes to the alpha-bug count. 

Which makes me question, are we supposed to leave the issue with the alpha-bug label open?

I feel the same way. As someone who got started on software engineering only in the past year or so (as did many of us in this course), I find the number of steps needed to add such a basic remark command to be overwhelming. I attempted the AB3 tutorial thinking it would only take an hour or so, especially since the remark command seemed almost trivial at first glance. 

But after going through the first few steps and coming to realise all the necessary files that one has to change to implement the command, I can't help but wonder if this level of extraction is helpful. I feel that if not for the diff being available to us, I would have never been able to dig through the file structure and find all the necessary files and lines of code that I have to edit to make the command work.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Question on Code Quality: Long Methods**
</div>

In week 5, under[ Code Quality section](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week5/topics.html#implementation-code-quality-readability-basic-avoid-long-methods), we were told that we should avoid long methods whenever we can, and try to stick to 30 LOC. However, does this rule still apply when we have control flow statements such as `switch`.

Screenshot attached for easier reference.
<img width="1148" height="282" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b995de-4348-46eb-a743-7887172373f3" />

In the case of my code, it would not make much sense to abstract it away and hence I would like to enquire when should we follow this rule for code quality.
```
        switch (command) ``{``
        case BYE:
            return new ExitCommand();
        case LIST:
            return new ListCommand();
        case FIND:

Thanks for sharing! Adding on to @Wen-Cong's method, which I personally tried and used, after unchecking the option "Indent 'case' branches", **in order to reformat existing code**, you will need to select the block to reformat and press ⌥⌘L (Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+L (Windows/Linux).

After that: 
- Old `switch` statements get fixed
- New `switch` statements you type will come out aligned automatically

Hi @ryan-toh, I looked at your repo and discovered that your "Level-6" tag is tagged to commit `60a4ecb`. This commit does not belong to any branch on your repository.
Solution:
Tag "Level-6" to commit `c673404`.

Hi @Abhijay25, here's an easy fix:

1. Open `Settings`
2. Go to `Editor → General`
3. Scroll to “On Save” section:
4. Untick all options such as `Remove trailing spaces on:` & `Remove trailing blank lines at the end of saved files`
5. Press `Apply` then `OK` to save the setting.

Result:
IntelliJ will no longer remove trailing whitespaces when you save files.

Yeah you got the idea. 
In this case, 

1. `+update(int)` of interface `Watcher` is currently unimplemented in this case, as seen in the code snippet.
2. The code snippet shows that the **abstract** class `ProgressWatcher` did not override `+update(int)`, thus `+update(int)` is omitted in the class diagram. 
3. The **concrete** class `UiWidget` is forced to override `+update(int)`. 

Hope this helps :)

</div>

### Link to JAR file: https://github.com/san4b0t/ip/releases/download/A-Release/sanbot.jar
 
### Which OS'es to test on: Windows | Mac | Linux

### Things to check specifically:
- create different types of tasks (todo, event, deadline)
- list
- mark, unmark
- delete
- find
- bye
- check if previously entered deadline tasks that are not completed appear as reminders when Sanbot is reopened

### Some example commands to run (can copy directly from here in order)
* todo laundry
* deadline cs2103 ip /by 19-09-2025 23:59
* event project meeting /from 19-09-2025 14:00 /to 19-09-2025 16:00
* find meeting (the project meeting event task should appear)
* bye
the window takes about 4 seconds to close
reopen the chatbot again (there should be a reminder to do cs2103 ip deadline task)
* mark 2
* bye 
the window takes about 4 seconds to close
reopen the chatbot again (there **should not** be a reminder to do cs2103 ip deadline task)

### Guide for testers:
* Post screenshots from your smoke tests
* Mention which OS you used for testing

I think this is valid OOP because it demonstrates encapsulation by keeping the valid commands within the scope of the Parser. However, I have kept my CommandType enums as a separate file to avoid cluttering up other classes, like the Parser which contains lots of methods.

Initialisation successful with no errors.

**Functions tested:**
- `todo`
- `deadline`
- `event`


Error handling on test input: `deadline return book /bySunday` 
<img width="399" height="628" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dbee863-785b-45fc-8cc5-8b788ecc7276" />

The program responds with `Unexpected error: Index 1 out of bounds for length 1`, which is unclear to the regular user and hence does not give any hints on correcting the command. However, the program does not crash; therefore, the error was handled.

Error handling on test input: `deadline return book /by Sunday` 

<img width="404" height="631" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c79d887-839a-47a3-878d-cfec7429db59" />

The program responded with `Huh?! Please enter date in yyyy-MM-dd format optionally followed by HH:mm`. However, the example of using the command given by the program did not include that date-time format. If using `/by Sunday` as part of the command is an expected behaviour, then this might be considered a bug. 

A similar issue occurs for test input: `event meeting /from Mon 2pm /to 4pm`, where it was unable to be parsed by the program.

<img width="398" height="628" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bab055f-6eee-4ea1-b82b-ddf34b3b0795" />


**Checked handling of program with expected commands:**
- `deadline assignment /by 2025-05-06`
-  `todo something`
-  `event hall games /from 2025-06-07 /to 2025-06-08`

Program responded correctly and added items to the`list`.

**Test program exit and reopening:**

Program exits with no errors on `bye` command. 

Program creates `/data` folder to save `tasks`.

Program reloads tasks successfully when initialised again within the same directory.

**Cosmetic testing:**

Resizing the window causes misalignment of the send and input boxes. However, the program is still able to receive and respond to commands correctly.

The program works and handles most expected inputs. However, it may need to be tweaked to fix the unexpected error that occurs when using inputs as "promised" by the given examples. 

It may be helpful to consider adding a help page in the app to guide users on the commands within the app, without referring to the User guide.

Maybe you can give a bit more context. e.g how did you generate the logo? what IDE you use? :) 
I tried to use [https://www.asciiart.eu/text-to-ascii-art](url) for my Logo. Maybe you can give it a try.

OS used Windows, initialisation was ok.

Functions tested: `todo eat dinner`
Invalid commands tested: `todo`, `tod`, `deadline e`

I think that Meow should give valid examples (when user makes a mistake in a command), i.e. `Sunday` is not a valid parseable `String`.

However, the emojis are no longer rendered properly.
I'm not sure if this is an issue on my end with WSL, so will need more Linux users to verify.

I have shifted from using text-ui-test (input.txt and expected.txt) to JUnit for a more automated testing approach. 

text-ui-test was useful before saving was implemented as there was no memory involved so outputs were always consistent. However, with the introduction of a file to save to and load from, it is more practical to utilize JUnit for future testing as it allows you to test individual features in a more stable and automated manner.

Hi prof and TA team, from the above screenshot, it is noted that 'Important use case missing' and 'important user stories missing' are counted as possible DG bugs. 

However, I am still very unclear about what constitutes as 'important'. If a feature has a fully working implementation but the team did not include a user story or use case for it in their DG, would that count as important? 

Thank you!

Thank you for the quick reply prof! 

However I am still confused. If the requirement is just for a team to give a few (1 per team member) use cases, how do I justify an 'important use case bug' if not all use cases are required to be documented.

Or in other words, as a team, are we supposed to document all use cases and user stories applicable to our project? Or can we stick to the few representative use cases that we have given at the start of the project. 
(I note that the information given above was in week 7 at the start of the project, and there may be more deliverables required for the end of the tP).

Thank you prof!

I found the same issue that when the date with the wrong format was written, I was not told what the issue was. Maybe the user experience here is mishandled. Maybe what could be done here is to let the user know the corrrect format in the form of an error message.

import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.layout.AnchorPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

/**

public class Main extends Application ``{``

    private Duke duke = new Duke();

    @Override

        try ``{``
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(Main.class.getResource("/view/MainWindow.fxml"));
            AnchorPane ap = fxmlLoader.load();
            Scene scene = new Scene(ap);
            stage.setScene(scene);
            fxmlLoader.<MainWindow>getController().setDuke(duke);  // inject the Duke instance
            stage.show();
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
            e.printStackTrace();
        ``}``
    ``}``
``}``
```
and line 20 is ``AnchorPane ap = fxmlLoader.load();`` where the error was reported. 

What does that mean and what should I do to correct it? Thanks!

hi! the display of characters are dependent on the terminal doing the display. this means that although it does not display right on your windows machine, it actually displays properly on a device with a different OS (eg. Mac). I also faced that issue on my Windows but works fine on my Mac. Maybe [this article](https://www.baeldung.com/java-char-encoding) would help you better understand Java character encoding on Windows!

I didn't test the UI class since it's mostly System.out.println() calls. As mentioned by others, your ACTUAL.txt and EXPECTED.txt tests already cover the output verification. May focus more JUnit tests on your business logic classes for parsing input or handling tasklist instead.

I tested it on Windows. I noticed that when adding a deadline task with /by 25/9/2025 2400 (an invalid time), the input is still accepted as valid.  Nonetheless, everything else works, all commands run fine, and I really like the UI design!

**1. :fas-info-circle: Mismatch between reasoning and response**
</div>

The team's response to one of my reports is `NotInScope`, but their reasoning for that seems to be that the feature flaw in question (i) was not promised and (ii) is not relevant to the target user. This sounds to me more like an argument for `Rejected` rather than `NotInScope` - I don't believe that they have successfully proven the point that rectifying the flaw I suggested is less important than the work that has been done.

My question is this: if I disagree with the reasoning for their response, but I possibly would have agreed with the response itself had their reasoning been better, should I be objecting to the response? i.e. will the arbiters make their own judgement of the bug independent of our discussion?

Thank you.

hello! not sure if this is the issue, but are you trying to adjust the indentation in the code editor in your screenshot? i also thought that that window was for you to indicate your preferences, but it seems like that is not the case.

for the switch statements, what worked for me was unchecking the setting under Wrapping and Braces --> 'switch' statement/expression --> indent case branches.

In my opinion, if your Ui class is only responsible for printing out strings required to the user, then i don't think there is a need to test this Ui class since it would mostly be using System.out.println() in most of your methods (I believe so). There is no point testing System.out.println() method since we sort of have to trust that it works as intended if not the whole chatbot wouldn't function as what we intend. 
Also as mentioned by others, if you really wanted to test what is printed out to the user, you could use the ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT files for testing that you did previously.

But while I was doing the practices in the videos in textbook, I noticed that there are times when (a) The visibility is omitted in the diagram and (b) in the code (such as in interfaces and abstract classes), the visibility is not clearly stated (e.g public vs protected) as seen in **Figure 2**. 

Hence, I want to clarify what's the standard practice when:
1. Code shows no visibility, do we also omit it in the diagram
2. Code shows visibility, then is it a must to include visibilty?
3. Is it a must to show everytime regardless of whether the code shows or not (then follow up question is how do we decide the visibility because there might be cases where multiple works)

Since the tutorial mentioned that you can have multiple endpoints, would it also be possible to have multiple start points or would that be wrong (aka many-to-one vs one-to-many)

One of my bug is considered as a duplicate of another bug, but the developer team did not give a response to the original bug issue. Does it mean its accepted? How can I see the severity of the original bug? Does it mean that my severity will follow the original bug?

Hello, I can confirm that your provided .jar file does not run on my Windows 11 system as well. 

In addition to the other suggestions, make sure that your Main Class is set to your Launcher class. 

```
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("xxxx.ui.Launcher")
``}``
```

When I changed my own Jar file's entry point to the Main Class (instead of Launcher), it results in the same error message you encountered.

For Java, if visibility modifier is not specified, then it is package private by default. Since watch and getInstance do not have any visibility attributed to it, it will be package private.

I believe this is due to Table enforcing the multiplicity that it must have 1 Door if a table object exists. The other examples have * which can imply 0 doors, but this one has 1 only, which implies a must exist. This is my understanding.

Tested on Windows. Application generally runs well but for timed tasks, the datetime format should be d/M/yyyy HHmm. Error handling (wrong input) could perhaps be rendered in the GUI so that the user knows why their tasks are not being added. Attached a screenshot of the errors I received in my terminal rather than the GUI.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Logging example in notes importing wildcard**
</div>


https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week6/topics.html#implementation-error-handling-logging-how

The example in the notes uses wildcard imports to import everything from `java.util.logging`

I thought we should avoid wildcard imports always?

We only need to do these 2 imports in this case right?
```
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
``` 

As a side question, if we actually need to import everything, do we still import one by one, or is it allowed in that case to import *

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on responding and justifying duplicates**
</div>

Our team has a simple documentation error that we have accepted, but it is also very clearly repeated over 3 different issues. We have since marked the issues as duplicate using the sub issue feature and choosing one of them as the original (as per stated in the course instructions). 

Some clarifications needed: 

1. Do we need to respond to all 3 issues? Or will a response to the original issue suffice? 

2. How do we justify that they are duplicates without cross referencing the issues? Do i just describe the issues the same way? How will a responding tester be able to judge whether it is a duplicate without seeing the other issues, or will they be able to?

3. One of the issues has the wrong severity label. Do i refute it by responding to the issue directly, or just in the original issue? (I guess this is only a question if the answer to question 1 is that we only respond to the original issue)

Currently we have opted to reply to all 3 issues separately, with basically the same response for each, except with extra clarifications for the issue with severity change. Is this okay?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Commit conventions: Conflicting info on first letter capitalisation.**
</div>

The commit convention document provided mentioned that subject lines should start with a capital letter. However a few lines down they suggest to use "scope: change" format, with the given examples: 

Person class: remove static imports
Main.java: Remove blank lines
bug fix: Add space after name

All three examples have differing standards for where capitalisation is required...

Additionally, common convention found online (also provided by the doc) seems to encourage the use of prefixes like "feat: ", "fix: ", "perf: " etc to type our commits, which all violate the rule of capitalisation. 

Any help on this matter is greatly appreciated, as my commits are in shambles right now.

@pokedot Ah thanks for linking that section. For some reason I did not see that the team comment on the original bug will be shown together in the duplicate. This clears everything up for me :)

As for your question, Im guessing that any comment or justification should be written in the parent bug's response. As such, since you are accepting the bug as is, no need to comment anything about the the parent bug, just include justification (and other comments you have) of the other duplicate bugs in the parent bug's response.

Will this affect my score for the iP or anything?

In Intellij, Go to Settings > Editor > Code Style > Java, select tab "Wrapping and Braces", scroll down the list to 'switch' statement, uncheck the option "Indent 'case' branches".

**1. :fas-info-circle: How multiple duplicate bugs are being handled when contesting**
</div>

Hi, clarifying the following:

Let's say we have a documentation inconsistency of a particular term in 3 places: (1 and 2 in the UG, and 3 in the DG)

Bug A reported 1 and 2 as inconsistent
Bug B reported 1 and 3 as inconsistent
Bug C reported 1, 2, and 3 as inconsistent.

Am I right to say that I am safe to mark A & B as duplicates of C? 

Will A be able to contest that their bug is not a duplicate of B (and vice-versa)? Or is it just for A to contest if it is not a duplicate of B & C (concurrently)

Hi, yes I have seen the previous linked issues, but they seem to refer to cases with just 2 bugs (1 being duplicate of the other), so I am not quite sure in the case of >2 bugs, whether the duplication check is handled pairwise among all possible combinations, or just each children issue with their parent issue.

Not sure if it helps, but what I did is to follow the example format given in the git convention docs:

e.g.
```
DialogBox: justify all text alignment
Label text is currently left-aligned, which can look uneven for multi-line messages.

Making the text justified improves readability and gives a cleaner, more professional appearance.

Let's,
* enable text wrapping on labels
* set text alignment to justify for all multi-line label content
```

Hi Prof,

In the early teammates form, we listed our product name as “Clinic AddressBook”. Since then, we standardised the name across our codebase and documents (User Guide, Developer Guide, README, release notes) to “CLInic.” 

The form is the only place where the old name remains.

Will this discrepancy be an issue, or is it necessary that we change it to “Clinic AddressBook”?

In my opinion, I feel the dependency arrow is not required but instead showing the method under section has a greater benefit for communication. However, this dependency is different from the composition that has been drawn, so there is value in indicating it on the diagram some way.

Tested on windows, specified commands works well, but seems to have error with saving and loading the file. The issue may be related to the file and directory creation used to store the text file. Otherwise works well, great job! 😄👍🏻

Looking at your forked repo, the package appears to be '''package BobMortimer.gui;'''
while the Main Class specified appears to be lowercases '''bobmortimer...'''

It's possible that the JVM treats those as distinct packages, hence it lead to the missing class error.

### Tested on Windows 11
Generally all the commands worked as expected. (Additionally tested the `help` command)

Screenshots:
<img width="200" height="auto" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc515a77-4866-40b8-9e8c-107bae62c7f3" />

<img width="200" height="auto" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8231507-3819-4cb5-bea3-5f7abba0d255" />

#### Some minor Issues encountered
- Formatting of text in `help` command looked a little unruly, especially for the tasks commands as seen below

<img width="300" height="auto" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a90d80e-bf42-4523-8d07-10c8968ff3a3" />

- After the `bye` command, the window remains. Users may mistake the program to be frozen. Perhaps modify the functionality to close after showing the Goodbye message.

### Closing Remarks
Overall good job 👍 Great styling and error handling.

Testing done on Windows. All the commands provided by you works fine, with some minor issues I noticed already highlighted by the previous testers above. However, I found 2 other issues after further testing.

### 1. Issue loading saved deadline and event tasks after closing and running the jar again
After running these commands:
```
todo read book
deadline return book /by 25/09/2025 23:59
event exam /from 30/09/2025 11:00 /to 30/09/2025 13:00
```

This is what is saved in the taskSave.txt file:

> T|0|read book
> D | 0 | return book | 25/9/2025 23:59
> D | 0 | exam | 30/9/2025 11:0 | 30/9/2025 13:0

It seems like there are some issues with the formatting for deadline and event tasks. After closing and running the jar again, the terminal shows "Oh no! The save is corrupted!" and writing the command list only shows 1 task - "[T][0] read book", with the event and deadline tasks gone.

### 2. No feedback for todo task with no content (minor issue)
Running just todo or todo with a space after produces a blank reply from the chatbot. 

<img width="636" height="892" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c11e68fb-e384-4980-96db-deea37216c1f" />

When this type of no content was tested for deadline and event, it returned a wrong format feedback. Perhaps this could be done for todo tasks as well?

### Closing remarks
Other than these 2 issues, the chatbot works well with a visually appealing GUI. Good job! :thumbsup:

**1. :fas-info-circle: LOC calculation**
</div>

Hi teaching team, 

I'd like to clarify how the feature freeze LOC limit is calculated, specifically regarding aggregated changes and how they are assessed.

The rules state that the limit is on added/edited lines, and that deleting lines does not count as a change.

Given this, please consider the following scenario for a single developer:

PR 1 Merged: Adds +80 LOC (functional code). This initial merge exceeds the 50 LOC limit, creating a violation.

PR 2 Merged: Removes -40 LOC (functional code), **specifically deleting lines that were introduced in PR 1.**

In that case, how will this sequence be assessed against the feature freeze rules?

Option A: Does the system aggregate the net change (80 - 40 = 40 LOC), meaning the developer is now in adherence and the violation is cleared?

Option B: Or, because "deleting lines does not count as a change," does the system only track the additions? In this case, will it permanently show +80 LOC of changes, meaning the violation persists even after the cleanup (PR 2)?

We are unsure if the dashboard (and by extension grading) will reflect Option A (net change) or Option B (permanent violation based on initial addition).

<img width="485" height="53" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b861d78-44aa-4151-8504-3ff5510099d2" />

For reference, here is what a sample graph from the repo looks like now (using feature freeze dashboard), where the blue triangle indicates +70 -15, while the sharp pink triangle indicates +0 -80; however due to the existence of the +70 from the first commit / PR we are not very sure how this change will be assessed.

If there are any existing features in the dashboard that are able to compute / evaluate overall changes do let us know too, and thank you for your help!

> So what I had initially done is edit the local README file (as shown in my latest screenshot), then pushed it to my fork. This for some reason, updated the README found on github, but did not include the emoji or strike through. Once I had followed the instructions [@jvvvstin](https://github.com/jvvvstin) commented, it worked a intended. So i was wondering why both methods had different outcomes.

The GFMD task requires you to use GFMD in your pull request description, not in the local README file. They are two different things, the README is only a description to your code.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Issue with JavaCI check running**
</div>

Hi guys, wondering if any of you are facing the same issue:

My tP group's PRs macos CI Checker cannot seem to run to completion and keeps getting cancelled after 15 minutes.

The following messages appear in the logs:

<img width="808" height="213" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4637464-27e3-4aa4-8fe6-27d727544e41" />

We have tried cancelling the workflow and re-running manually, as well as letting it run to cancellation and trying again. However, all of these attempts have failed. 

This causes an issue as my group cannot merge our PRs and continue with the project.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to resolve this? Thank you!

Also seems like this solution only works if u cancel the workflow within a certain window + once u do it once it seems to work without needing to cancel for subsequent PRs? Makes me wonder if its a server side demand thing :) anyways thanks bro!

Hi @damithc, 

The course website indicates that our evaluation is based on reporting a certain percentage of the total bugs found in the product. However, Phase IV requires us to select and submit a maximum of six polished bug reports to the development team.

My product under evaluation appears to be quite buggy, and I have identified more than six issues. I would like to check if are the bugs identified during testing but ultimately not chosen for submission (i.e., those beyond the mandatory limit of six) still counted toward the calculated "percentage of bugs found" in the product?

Probably shouldn't change the CI/CD workflow, it should work. 

Have you tried:
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger build"

Maybe ask your teammate to open the PR for you then.

or 

Are u PRing into the right repo or branch?

### Tested on MacOS

Looks good to me! The task features all function as expected.

One issue that stands out to me is that your ASCII art does not display correctly on my screen.

From the PE guidelines, I understand that we have to write a team response comment for issues that are duplicates of another issue. Could I clarify if we need to manually link the child issue to the parent (e.g. using `#3`) in the response or is it automatically linked once marked as a duplicate? Would the tester for the child issue (i.e. the duplicate) be able to view the parent issue?

Personally, I would separate them. This would allow the enum to be used by multiple classes if needed and also reduce clutter in the Parser class.
However, if your use case is only within the Parser class, I think it is perfectly fine to leave it as it is.

I am stuck on `A-Gradle`, I progressed through the project without an IDE, and was running my files with a barebones `build.gradle` file. Upon merging with `add-gradle-support`, was when I first encountered this error. 

## What I have tried

Initially assumed I incorrectly resolved the conflicts from the `build.gradle`, so I replaced it entirely with the `add-gradle-support` version - same error.

Tried adding the plugin manually myself into my own `build.gradle` file - same error. 

Went to checkout the official repo of [shadow](https://github.com/GradleUp/shadow) and found out documentation recommends using an updated plugin ID: [com.gradleup.shadow](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradleup.shadow) - same error

`./gradlew cleanBuildCache` - same error

Use intelliJ, I followed the IntelliJ setup - same error

Delete all Java JDK and Gradle, and installed them back again - same error

[Project unable to find gradle shadow plugin](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74867313/project-unable-to-find-gradle-shadow-plugin) - same error

I have smoke tested your JAR file on my system (Windows 11). With reference the user guide linked in the help command, I have not found any technical errors with the application. The commands are all working as per intended, and the persistent storage is working well. The application also starts from a clean state if there are errors resulting from the data manipulation by users. Good job!

I think putting Command and Parsed in their own files is cleaner.
Right now Parser already does a lot, and having extra types inside makes the file longer and harder to read. If we split them out, each file will have a single clear responsibility and will be easier to maintain later on.

Hi, I have tested out the program on my Windows 11 OS. Apart from the already report error in the mismatch between the GUI in the user guide and the actual application, I also see the error of the example add command not working, as shown in the picture. If something is given as an example, I believe it should work. In this case, you might wanna change the program's functioning to accept the example command or change the example command to something the program would accept. Good luck!

The program works on my Windows system. Every command listed to test seems is functional and not bugged. One possible improvement would be to raise an error for cases where an event’s start time is later than its end time as these are invalid event entries.

Hi @siangjun2 , I ran this on Windows OS, and overall it runs smoothly.

Some suggestions: You could make the error message more specific, perhaps suggest a valid format for the different commands.
You could also perhaps suggest a list of valid commands available when an unknown command is being inputed.

Overall, well done with the clean GUI design!

A (bug) that I found was that your event command still accepts input date/times for the start and end even if the end is at a earlier date than the start, which shouldn't be the case. 
Other than that, the application looks fine. Good job !

I agree with @haobuhaoo, i think the enum itself should be in PascalCase whereas the members of the enum should be in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

Hi, tested using MacOS 15.5. I think I tried almost all functionalities, and it worked as expected. Minor issue is also the duplicated [D] and [E] for deadline and event tasks, as mentioned by @wongyuzhen too, and just a small nitpick -- the width of the response bubble could be increased for better readability of instructions. But overall, there is not much of an issue in terms of functionality. Cool animation, great job!

@Sophie-lmy I faced the same issue, I managed to resolve it by following the advice above and changing "Scheme" to "Project" instead of "Default", then unchecking the same "indent case" checkbox and reformatting the code (⌘ + ⌥ + L). It automatically unindented all the "case" immediately.

I just considered task inputs that don't start with todo/deadline/event as error and my chatbot would tell users that it is an invalid task type. I guess by doing so I don't have to handle a lot of additional task types and users won't have to decide amongst a wide range of task types to categorise their tasks in. But I guess it is up to you to decide if you want to create a task type to generalise the rest of the tasks that are not todo/deadline/event.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Request for permission to combine an independently-fixable yet similar problem that appeared in more than five distinct places into one bug report**
</div>

Although I am aware that combining similar bug reports is only for the developer teams, can I also combine very similar documentation bugs together in one bug report? Specifically, I want to group issues where the UG lists incorrect error messages that do not apply to the corresponding feature — likely due to indiscriminate copy-pasting of messages from related features.
Will combining them in this way affect grading or cause any penalties? Also, I am unsure whether the teaching team will treat each example as a separate issue when reviewing the report.

I ran `java -jar taskbot.jar` on Windows, and it failed with the `JavaFX runtime components are missing` error.
However, the application ran successfully after I used the command `java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar taskbot.jar`.
Do you use fat JAR?

However, Github's safety feature puts the newly created organization name in quarantine for up to 90 days, and we are unable to create another organization with the name assigned to us. 

We would like to check if there is any workaround for this, if it is possible to rename our assigned name. We have contacted github support as well to retrieve our organization name.

I separated my parser and command class. I don't think it is necessary, nor good practice, to nest commands inside the parser because if we think about maintainability, having separate classes for all the different commands makes it easier and cleaner. I did something similar to @monnss69 , parser.parse() returns a command, and that command can be executed.

Hello! I have some questions regarding the ratings

From the announcement it states that :

"You may ignore small (&lt;5%) differences between the contribution ratings you've received and the rating you think you deserve, because such small difference are unlikely to affect your marks. Plus, minor deviations could be due to rounding off errors."

Can i ask if its borderline -5% reflected will it affect my marks?

I am fine with the numbers if it doesn't affect, but i feel like it would be unfair if it does affect, cause I believe that each member in my team generally did contribute fairly and equally

I would suggest to separate them, although they are conceptually tied, a parser should not have-a command in my opinion. In my implementation, the parser only reads input and possibly a call for the execution of a command based on the input.

This is a very interesting question. It feels more like functional programming rather than OOP, so I'm not sure if the concepts of association/dependency apply to this scenario. However, if one of them do, I would think that it is not an association because there isn't actually any reference to a List of Class B. Rather, Class A contains a reference to an unknown Class which satisfies the Consumer interface, and thus has an "accept" method which takes in a List of Class B. So while Class A is not related to Class B at all, we could probably say that Consumer&lt;Class B> is dependent on Class B

Hi, I think the issue is with your build.gradle file. It's missing the necessary dependencies for windows and linux (Only has mac).

So in your dependencies in build.gradle file, just paste this in (includes your dependencies for mac).

I think it is good OOP practice to nest Command and Parsed inside Parser as they are both conceptually tied to Parser (ie. they are not used independently). By encapsulating them it can prevent accidental misuse outside the parsing context. Unless you anticipate reusing them in a different context, or if they become too complex to maintain, then I would consider separating them.

This is what I found online: Persistence: Associations are typically more persistent relationships, often represented by attributes or fields, while dependencies can be more temporary, such as a local variable within a method. From the given context, Class A contains the variable Consumer&lt;List&lt;Class B>>, signifying that it is an association relationship. However, if the variable is within a method, it can arguably be dependency.

Here are a few suggestions you might want to address:
1. Having multiple spaces after the `mark`, `unmark`, and `delete` commands (e.g. `mark    1`) throws a `NumberFormatException` in the terminal and cannot be sent into the bot. Maybe you want to handle this more gracefully and ignore the multiple spaces?
2. Sending the commands `todo`, `find`, `mark`, and `unmark` with no parameters throws unhandled errors, which again prevents it from being sent into the bot. Maybe try to catch these and have the bot suggest the correct format to the user?
3. Sending `list 123` still lists all tasks, and `bye bye` exits the bot. Maybe it is more guarded to only accept `list` and `bye` without different formats or extra arguments?

I think the main advantage of the forking workflow is that it allows pull requests to be developed in parallel. Since we haven’t encountered many complex scenarios yet, it may be difficult to visualise its benefits, but I believe this workflow provides greater flexibility. We can work on multiple features at the same time, or continue developing new ones while waiting for earlier pull requests to be reviewed and merged, which can prove to be highly useful, for instance, when dealing with a time crunch.

Another important aspect is that the master branch in each fork is usually meant to mirror the upstream master. This makes it easier to keep progress synchronised across team members and to clearly distinguish between stable code and ongoing development. If we made all changes directly in the master branch, we would lose this separation, which could lead to conflicts and confusion in larger or more complex team structures.

As for the second question, my understanding is that the changes will only appear in the team repo’s master branch once the pull request has been reviewed and merged, usually by another team member. So the process is usually as follows: 

1. Submit a pull request from a separate branch in your fork.
2. Pull request gets merged into upstream's master by another team member.
3. You update your fork's local repo by pulling or fetching from the upstream master branch
4. The local repo now contains the changes automatically, without needing to re-merge the branch to your master manually
5. Push the local repo's master to the fork's remote to update your remote to the latest version of the codebase.

I think the videos in the website explain this process better than I did, so you can check them out at [tP Briefing (Part 2a -- v1.1, Workflow).](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/index.html) This was quite useful for me.

This is my current understanding, others may have additional insights to add.

I separated my commands from the parser. While they are closely related and storing the commands in the parser is a form of encapsulation, the script may become unmanageable once you start having more commands to keep track of.  In addition, I find it easier to debug or change them in the future when each command is in a separate script.

**1. :fas-info-circle: PE: What can be considered a bug caused by errorneous edits to datafile**
</div>



The website states that “'if you edit the file correctly, things will work; but if you edited it wrongly, there's no guarantee that things will work'. At least that level of support should be provided in the product as well.” 

“No guarantee that things will work” is a little vague for defining what can be considered a bug. Would all errors involving errorneous edits be protected under this rule? The website also states:

Bugs can be filed in the following cases:
(a) The product's support for editing the data files is less than that of AB3.

AB3 UG talks about how the program is able to recover from errorneous inputs by starting from a blank slate, but it also states: “certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways” which is also vague.

If the code introduced by the team somehow causes a deviation in the default behaviour of AB3, and results in a failure to recover, ie start from a blank file, should they be held accountable, or are they protected under the above rule?

Tested the features and everything appeared as intended. No glitches observed during use.

Just noticed a minor bug where the line at the top and bottom of the reply box is a bit too long and went on to the next line.

From the textbook, 
"The 'Operations' compartment and/or the 'Attributes' compartment may be omitted if such details are not important for the task at hand."
The class name -&gt; attribute -&gt; operations is specific to the order (if both sections exist, they should be in this order).

**1. :fas-info-circle: Should we keep updating text-ui-test input/expected for testing remaining features?**
</div>


Hi, I have a question about testing the remaining features of our project.

Do we still need to continue updating the text-ui-test input.txt and expected.txt to test the remaining functionality?

The problem is:

runtest.bat cannot reliably test the save/load functionality.

Because of save/load, the expected output may change every time we run the program, so expected.txt would need to be updated constantly.

If we do need to continue updating, is there a recommended solution to handle this, so that the tests remain predictable and manageable?

Thanks!

Rah-Rah-Mitra's has done a good job identifying the root of the problem, but it isn't entirely correct.

The problem is not that the `gradlew` file cannot be executed, but rather the `runtest.sh` file. To fix this, you can either remove the last two sections which run `text-ui-test`, or modify the `runtest.sh` test to be this:

```
      - name: Perform IO redirection test (*NIX or macOS)
        if: runner.os == 'Linux' || runner.os == 'macOS'
        working-directory: $``{`` github.workspace ``}``/text-ui-test
        run: chmod +x runtest.sh && ./runtest.sh
```
