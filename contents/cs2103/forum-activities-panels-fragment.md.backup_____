**2. :fas-info-circle: UML Labels vs Stereotypes**
</div>

Under the [Stereotypes section](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/schedule/week4/topics.html#tools-uml-stereotypes), the following example was given: 

> UML stereotypes are a lightweight extension mechanism for adding domain-specific meaning to existing UML elements without changing the core UML language. They label elements such as classes, objects, or relationships with roles or semantics beyond their default interpretation (for example, `<<entity>>`, `<<create>>`, `<<facade>>`), helping readers understand intent, architectural responsibilities, or usage patterns at a glance. Stereotypes do not change the fundamental structure of the model; instead, they enrich it with contextual meaning, often forming part of a UML profile tailored to a particular problem domain.

**Question:** In the diagram shown, why don't we use a label "create" rather than the stereotype `<<create>>`? How do we ascertain when to use a Label vs Stereotype?

**3. :fas-info-circle: UML Aggregation: Does it need to be at the concept level?**
</div>

Under UML [Composition](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/schedule/week4/topics.html#modeling-composition), it was mentioned that

> Cascading deletion alone is not sufficient for composition. Suppose there is a design in which Person objects are attached to Task objects and the former get deleted whenever the latter is deleted. This fact alone does not mean there is a composition relationship between the two classes. For it to be composition, a Person must be an integral part of a Task in the context of that association, at the concept level (not simply at implementation level).

Could I clarify if the above also applies for Aggregation (i.e. in order to have an aggregation association, there needs to be a conceptual container-containee relationship and not simply at implementation level)?

**6. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on Java Coding Standard for Lambda Expressions**

When running the CheckStyle script, it highlighted that the following code violates the coding standard:

        assertThrows(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class,
                () -&gt; ``{`` Storage.deserialiseTask("T|0"); ``}``
        );
    ``}``
'''
CheckStyle Violations Shown:
- '(' should be on the previous line. [SeparatorWrap]. This refers to the left bracket of the lambda expression
- '``{``' at column should have line break after. [LeftCurly]. This refers to the first curly brace after ->

&lt;br>

However, the following does not violate the coding standard:
Example 2:
'''java
    public void deserialiseTask_invalidTodo_exceptionThrown() ``{``
        assertThrows(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class, (
                ) -&gt; ``{``

Could I clarify if lambda expressions also need to follow the Egyptian brackets mentioned in our coding standard, or would Example 1 meet the coding standard in this case? (i.e. the Java Coding Standard given to us does not mention specifically for lambda expressions, and we are free to choose our own style as long as it is consistent)

I understand that for the purpose of iP Grading, the [following](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/admin/ip-grading.html) was stated on our Course website:

> Implementation [10 marks]
> - More than 90% of all deliverables have been completed in the final version of the iP submitted.

> When a requirement specifies a minimal version of it, simply reaching that minimal version of the requirement is enough for it to be counted for grading -- however, we recommend you to go beyond the minimal; the farther you go, the more practice you will get.

This is clear for tasks like [Level-5](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/schedule/week2/project.html#level-5-handle-errors) that specify all three Minimal, Typical and Stretch Goals.

**17. :fas-info-circle: Explicit declaration of unchecked exception in throws clause**
</div>

In the [[Key Exercise] parse rectangle descriptor](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/schedule/week1/topics.html#key-exercise-parse-rectangle-descriptor), the Partial solution for `calculateArea` method indicates the clause `throws IllegalShapeException` which I understand as a checked exception is subject to the **_Catch or Specify Requirement_**.

While I understand unchecked exceptions need not follow the **_Catch or Specify Requirement_**, are there best practices of whether to specify them in the `throws` clause?

For example, would the following full solution be correct:
```
public class Main ``{``

    public static void printArea(String descriptor)``{``
        try ``{``
            System.out.println(descriptor + "=" + calculateArea(descriptor));
        ``}`` catch (NumberFormatException e) ``{``
            System.out.println("WIDTH or HEIGHT is not a number: " + descriptor);
        ``}`` catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) ``{`` // We catch and handle here
             // print error message  
        ``}`` catch (IllegalShapeException e) ``{`` // We catch and handle here
             // print error message  
        ``}``
    ``}``

    private static int calculateArea(String descriptor) throws IllegalShapeException ``{`` // Do not need to declare unchecked exceptions here
        String[] dimensions = descriptor.split("x");

        //throw IllegalShapeException here if dimensions.length > 2

        return Integer.parseInt(dimensions[0]) * Integer.parseInt(dimensions[1]);

        // Integer.parseInt already throws NumberFormatException and attempting to access an invalid index/element in the
        // dimensions array would cause IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown. 
        // Hence our method does not need to throw either of these unchecked exceptions here. Would this be correct?
    ``}``

Hi, I believe point 1 from this [T4L1 extract](https://git-mastery.org/lessons/show/index.html#t4l1-examining-a-commit) below answers part of your question:

> **Although each commit represents a copy of the entire working directory, Git uses space efficiently in two main ways:**
> **1. Reuse of unchanged data:** If a file hasn’t changed since a previous commit, the commit simply points to the already stored version of that file instead of making another copy. This means only new or changed files take up extra space, while unchanged files are reused.
> **2. Compression:** Git also compresses all the files and data it stores using an algorithm (zlib). So, even the objects that are stored (whether reused or new) take up less disk space because they are saved in a compressed format.

From my understanding, files that are unchanged will not be in the index/staging area, but rather the commit will point to these unchanged files (as specified in the extract above) so that the commit can function as a full snapshot to recreate the working directory if required. 

With regards to file tracking, when we stage a file, git will automatically track the file (if it is not already being tracked) for the repository (and hence will continue to be tracked for all future commits). Here is an extract from [T1L4](https://git-mastery.org/lessons/stage/):
> **Staging applies regardless of whether a file is currently tracked.**
> * Staging an untracked file will both begin tracking the file and include it in the next snapshot.
> * Staging an already tracked file will simply mark its current changes for inclusion in the next commit.

Additionally, in order to stop git from tracking the files in the repository, we can specify it in a `.gitignore` file (you may refer to [T2L6 ](https://git-mastery.org/lessons/ignore/) for further information).

Hi, thanks for the response. It seems that after including build.gradle, the project is using the SDK `Eclipse 17.0.12` regardless of SDK setting in Intellij (it is set to `OpenJDK 17.0.17` for me). 

Is anyone else encountering the same issue (i.e. when trying to either Build and run application **or** run tests using IntelliJ IDEA (not Gradle), the first line shows that the Java version used is `Eclipse 17.0.12` instead of using the Project SDK set in Intellij e.g. `OpenJDK 17.0.17`)?

I have checked the `build.gradle` file but it doesn't appear there are any configuration for this:

```

Hi, I believe the suggested style suggests "import static all other imports" as the first line (its the first grey line at the top).

With regards to "import module imports", I too encountered a similar issue (shown in the latest Intellij but not in suggested style).

Other than the suggestions above, another alternative I can think of is for the `Storage` class to have a `loadTasks(TaskList)` method. This way, by passing an instance of TaskList, the `Storage` class will still be responsible for reading from storage (i.e. loading archived data from the file to the TaskList instance) and can call an `addTask` instance method to load into the TaskList instance.

`Storage` remains responsible for reading from file, while `TaskList ` is responsible for adding tasks to the list. This allows for the possibility of modifying the internal data structure of `TaskList` in the future, without needing to modify `Storage` (e.g. the return type of the `loadTasks` method).

From the perspective of both the designer and a user, I feel that if the storage file is detected as corrupted, the chatbot could initialise and start afresh (i.e. not utilising the corrupted storage file, and potentially overriding or archiving it) while notifying the user about the storage file corruption. 

This allows the user to:
1. Be aware of the corruption (and why previously saved tasks aren't loading).
2. Still use the application.

And from the designer's point of view: 
1. There are less risks of further corruption in the storage file inadvertently affecting the correctness of the application and the chatbot's behaviour.

A diagram shown [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/schedule/week4/tutorial.html), shows an example of this where the `Student` class does not show the inherited attributes and methods from `Person` class.

Would my understanding below be correct:
**Dependency:** Able to use only stereotypes
**Association:** Able to use either labels or stereotypes

When to use:
* Use Stereotype to define custom elements (e.g. when there are multiple places we would like to indicate the stereotype `&lt;&lt;create>>` such that it could be repeated several times)
* Use labels to add information to element (may not be repetitive)

> If compartments may be omitted, and the attributes/operations themselves can also be omitted if deemed irrelevant to the purpose of the diagram, then how will we represent a class with no attributes (and/or operations)?

I believe that you are right to conclude that it would be difficult to differentiate a class with no attributes/operations from one that does but omits it. My understanding is that the UML diagram is not meant to specify exactly all the attributes/operations of the class but rather those that are relevant for the purpose of what that specific UML diagram is trying to illustrate/communicate.


> By the same token, when looking at a UML class diagram, is it correct to say that even if the class diagram has an empty attribute compartment, we cannot conclude that the class has no attributes, right?

My view is that the static methods can be made more general, such as accepting the message to be printing through parameters. That would allow flexibility and would not require a new method if there is a new message that needs to be printed. 

Alternatively, instance-level methods would be appropriate if the message is passed into the constructor of the `Ui` class, and the methods would refer to the instance fields for the messages to be printed.

I agree with the above on steps to make it more user friendly. Adding on, you mentioned corrupted with invalid or wrong entries. If the file contains invalid or wrong entries (but is still readable), the application could attempt to skip or recover valid entries and reinitialise the file using those. I think we can also have stronger validation before persisting entries too.

However, if we're talking about truly corrupted files (e.g. cannot be opened or parsed at all), recovery may not be feasible for a plain text file, and reinitialising a new file with a clear error message might be more reasonable.

I also agree that it's meant to be for colon used in switch statements, referring to `case x:` instead.

Normally, we keep the operators separated with whitespace on both sides from other variables/operators but in the case it should be attached to the value instead.

    case x: // colon attached to x instead of case x :
        // some code here

I think its a good idea to default to non-static classes, some classes need state (use non-static) while others don't (use static).

Storage class would be better as a non-static class since the location of the file is a state that relates to an instance of the Storage class.

If it were static, can we create another instance of Storage class for a file in another location?

A clearer example for what I mentioned, let's take Storage vs Parser.

'''java
Storage mainStorage = new Storage("duke.txt");
Storage backupStorage = new Storage("backup.txt"); // notice this would not be possible if Storage were static

mainStorage.save(tasks);       // writes to duke.txt
backupStorage.save(tasks);     // writes to backup.txt
'''

And for Parser we have something like this.

'''java
Parser.parse("todo read book");
Parser.parse("deadline submit report /by 2026-01-30");
'''

Since Parser holds no state, it's suitable to be written as a static class.

Personally, I used the Storage class within TaskList by passing a Storage instance when creating a TaskList.

This way, TaskList remains the abstraction responsible for managing tasks, while Storage is only concerned with persistence (reading/writing to disk). The underlying data structure (e.g. ArrayList&lt;Task>) stays hidden inside TaskList, which improves encapsulation and reduces coupling, still some degree of coupling though.

I think your approach works well too. By returning a TaskList instead of a generic collection, you’re reinforcing abstraction and keeping implementation details hidden. Though as the above comments mention, there might be issues if TaskList methods change.

I would think it's still better to use imports without wildcards. In the event that we update the code to not use all classes in the package in the future, we might not realise that.

If it were imports without wildcards, our IDE would be able to tell that we have unused imports.

Personally, I think I would use saveTransaction() making it start with is/has makes it seem like it doesn't mutate/change attributes/state.

I think it's common to return true/false or some integer to show success so it wouldn't need to be in the name or at least it is how its written in some database libraries, but I do think also trySaveTransaction works or maybe returning an integer works too?

It seems the reason is because of the different commit histories, I looked into your commit history and it seems you do not have the commits from the ip repo. Could I ask how you forked the repository? Did you potentially clear all commits, didn't fetch the commits or did a force push initially?

The force push likely did an overwrite of all the previous commits hence the different commit histories. There were likely merge commits preventing the push initially that you had to resolve.

You could check out `git reflog` to retrieve the previous commit before your force push assuming git garbage collector hasn't removed it. Would be a good point to create a new branch with your current commits before you reset to the point before your force push. Then, merge it back into master.

I'm not sure if this is recommended for this course, specifically whether it might change the timestamps of your commit.

    Platform.runLater(() -&gt; ``{``
        PauseTransition delay = new PauseTransition(Duration.millis(500)); // to allow time to view the response
        delay.setOnFinished(evt -&gt; Platform.exit());
        delay.play();

> `Integer.parseInt` already throws `NumberFormatException` and attempting to access an invalid index/element in the dimensions array would cause `IndexOutOfBoundsException` to be thrown. Hence our method does not need to throw either of these unchecked exceptions here. Would this be correct?

From &lt;a href = "https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/schedule/week1/topics.html#c-to-java-exceptions-how-to-use-exceptions"> the notes&lt;/a>, it mentions that it is optional to follow the Catch or Specify Requirement for unchecked exceptions. So we don't actually need to specify a `throws` clause for `NumberFormatException` and `IndexOutOfBoundsException` in this case, and your code will still compile. In general, we don't catch or specify an unchecked exception because it usually cannot be anticipated and recovered from.

In my opinion, I would say that specifying a `throws` clause for unchecked exception is more of a design choice. For example, your method `printArea` is already anticipating that an invalid user input would cause the method to fail, and it uses `try-catch` to recover from it. That means `NumberFormatException` and `IndexOutOfBoundsException` behave more similarly to a checked exception rather than an unchecked exception in this scenario. You could specify the `throws` for `calculateArea` as an indication for other programmers to be prepared for this failure, but the downside would be that it &lt;a href= "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html">reduces clarity&lt;/a>. If you defined a custom exception that is anticipated and can recovered from, then you should convert it into a checked exception instead.

> Another way to motivate the "non-need" to throw and catch unchecked exceptions comes from CS2030S, in the notes here: https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2425-s1/22-exception.html#unchecked-exceptions
> 
> Unchecked errors like `IndexOutOfBoundsException` should never occur if the perfect programmer checks all indices before retrieving elements from that index, but no programmer can anticipate, at the time of coding, if a certain file (whose filename is given by a user) will be found on disk. Hence, checked exceptions such as `FileNotFoundException` have to be handled, by using exception handling code.
> 
> Hence, to answer your question about throwing and checking unchecked exceptions, if I were to write code to throw/catch unchecked exceptions, I would question why that exception would arise in the first place and add if-guards (e.g. checking if a variable is non-null before unpacking it).
> 
> Just my two cents :)

I agree with this point. It's generally good programming practice to use `if-else` as opposed to `try-catch`for better clarity and performance, but in this case we would just need to follow the exercise instructions (to catch the 2 unchecked exceptions). Also, we should not use exceptions as a control flow mechanism, as stated in the CS2030S notes (just use `if-else`).

If you are using PAT, you don't need to key in your username/password. The GUI you posted is similar to what I have.

Hi, I would like to recommend the `--oneline` flag for `git log`, then just check if the first few values of the SHA hash match. This should still show the commit message's subject (which is needed here).

You can also do git `--no-pager` log to print out the entire commit log without using the pager.

**Note:** You should try to do `gitmastery reset progress` first just in case the SHA values were modified by something, for example a `git rebase`.

> For IP Level-5, are we supposed to terminate the program after an error occured (by throwing exception), or merely display an error message but continue running the program?

I believe that you should display the error message then ask the user for the next command.

> Also, I am confused about how a custom DukeException class would be useful. Right now I am making invalid user inputs throw a DukeException, but I am not sure how that would be different from just throwing a regular exception.

There's quite a few reasons why a command would be invalid, like an invalid parameter or the wrong flag (e.g. `/by`) was used. You can split these different errors into separate exceptions so that they return different meaningful error messages.

From my understanding, the design should be up to you (i.e. whether the chatbot prints an error message or continues to run when the saved file is corrupted).

However, it is likely that a file that is corrupted will remain corrupted as the user would not be able to fix it manually. Therefore reinitializing a new saved file makes more sense in this case.

A true getter would mean something like this:

'''java
Item getItem() ``{``
    return this.item;
``}``
'''
So if your getter deviates from this behaviour, it is likely that you want to include a JavaDoc since the user may misunderstand what it is meant to do.

I believe the stereotype `&lt;&lt;create>>` in this case is to just help the user to understand what the dependency means in that particular context. You can remove stereotypes from your UML diagram and the relationship will still be valid, with the exception of `&lt;&lt;interface>>` and `&lt;&lt;enumeration>>`.

Labels are used mainly for associations if I'm not mistaken, and they define the meaning of the association. Labels should not be removed if we want to differentiate between objects in object diagrams. In class diagrams, they should be kept if the user must know what is the exact relationship between two classes.

> Would my understanding below be correct:

From my understanding, this sounds correct.

> When to use:
>     * Use Stereotype to define custom elements (e.g. when there are multiple places we would like to indicate the stereotype `&lt;&lt;create>>` such that it could be repeated several times)
>     * Use labels to add information to element (may not be repetitive)

Kind of true, with some caveats. Both can add info to a specific association, but stereotypes _identify_ the "type" of association (that is usually optional) and labels are more specific in _explaining_ the relationship between 2 classes (that is usually required).

Yes there is.

In your `MainWindow.java`, the following closes the window:
```
Stage stage = (Stage) dialogContainer.getScene().getWindow();
stage.close();
```

You can put the above code snippet in the method that handles user input.

Hi @Arrus218, have you tried creating a brand new directory to set up Git Mastery in? 

I remember getting this issue when attempting to sync my progress across 2 machines, and believe I circumvented it by creating a brand new directory for Git Mastery to run its setup. Try running `gitmastery progress sync on` again afterwards!

If my memory serves me right, the repos downloaded in your previous Git Mastery directory will not be synchronized, only your progress for the exercises.

Hope this helps!

Afterwards, I ran `ls -al` to check for the presence of the 'progress/' directory.

Are the following files similar to the ones in your fork of `gitmastery-progress`?

For me, I am using Git for Windows (**_v2.52.0_**) with an SSH key. My version of GitHub CLI is **_v2.85.0_** (_windows_amd64_). Not sure if they could have affected the outcome.

If not, the only remaining potential issues I can think of are:

1. `gitmastery.exe` not added to Windows System Variable `PATH`
2. Folder used is controlled by OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.

If you still run into issues, you could try renaming the directory with issues to `gitmastery-exercises-old`, and then creating a new directory called `gitmastery-exercises` (which is the default folder name used during setup) to run `gitmastery setup` and attempt to sync your progress again. 

Hope this fixes your issue!

Windows by default uses backslashes `\`, which can be seen when you open up Command Prompt/PowerShell.

However, if you were to use a Macbook, its Terminal uses forward slashes `/` by default.

Step 1 in the 'Setting Up' section likely assumes you are using a Windows machine, thus using a backslash `\` instead of a forward slash `/`.

It is also why there is both `runtest.bat` and `runtest.sh` available for you to run tests. The `.bat` file is used by those in Windows environments, while the `.sh` file is used by those in Unix environments _(e.g. Terminal on MacBooks)_.

Hi @b2-4ac, is using a newer version of Gradle a solution you might want to consider?

You can configure Gradle to use a newer version which supports Java 21 (_major version 65_), which can hopefully circumvent this issue of `Unsupported class file major version 65`.

To do this, you can head to `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` and edit accordingly/as required, with the image below as a reference:

<img width="659" height="179" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3adce6f3-70e1-424f-9be8-908e0233aa01" />

I am currently using Gradle 8.5, which has helped me to get rid of this Java version incompatibility issue.

Synchronize your Gradle with the new changes made, or run `.\gradlew clean build` and `.\gradlew clean run` to see if your program runs now, while forcing Gradle to install the new version.

Hope this fixes your issue!

Hi @gwhrg, 

Have you tried adding a browser-specific (_e.g. Safari/Chrome_) keyboard shortcut to override the default shortcuts set by the website? 

I personally use a Windows machine, but there should be a Mac-equivalent way to set keyboard shortcuts on Safari/Chrome, depending on the browser you are using.

I did a Google search and the results seem to point towards heading to `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > App Shortcuts`. You should then be able to add an application-specific keyboard shortcut for the `Find...` function.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Question for UML**
</div>

Hello, I had a separate set of questions for UML notations.

1. Suppose that we have a `Person` class that has `Pet pet;` attribute, but `Pet` does not store `Person`. Then, I just wanted to clarify why we put multiplicity of `1` on the `Person` side when `Pet` does not store anything. Is it because once an association is constructed through the `Person` class, there should be 1 `Person` class involved in that connection? So, basically multiplicity is not about storing a reference but more fundamentally about participation?
2. In W4.2b, Implementing associations section, it stated that: **You use instance level variables to implement associations.** I just want to ask what if class `B` was declared as `static` in class `A` (e.g., maybe because class `B` is a data class.) Then, do we model this as association same as **instance level variables**? Or `static` is often different?
3. Does association role typically named the same as attribute name, or can it be different?
4. Do we need to explicitly mention the inherited methods/attributes for inheritance/implementation in the diagram? Or can we assume that people will typically know it through the inheritance/implementation relationship we indicate in the diagram?
5. We don't include Constructors in our diagram, right? Since those are not methods (especially in Java)?
6. When we draw an object diagram, how do we represent an enumeration object? E.g., for POOR value of `Rating` enumeration, is the following acceptable? 
<img width="238" height="126" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6287b759-a3df-4827-a643-20c3bd211f58" />

7. In an object diagram, if we want to indicate an association using attribute instead of line, and if we have to indicate an instance of an object which does not have a name as a value, how do we indicate it? E.g., consider `StockItem` storing `Review` object as `review`, but the `Review` object has be initialized without a name and passed directly to `StockItem` constructor.
8. When we indicate association through a line, how do we indicate visibility if we want to?

**4. :fas-info-circle: Confusing Explanation in Git-Mastery Tour 4 (4.4 and 4.5)**
</div>

Hello, I am posting this forum because I was a bit confused with certain descriptions in 4.4 and 4.5 of GitMastery, and thought it would have been better (though it is already doing great) if the descriptions are slightly modified. If there's anything I got wrong, do let me know as well. Thanks in advance.

### [Regarding 4.4, `git checkout`]
In this section, the following explanation is given for *git checkout abortion*:
"""
**If there are uncommitted changes in the working directory, Git proceeds with a checkout only if it can preserve those changes.**

- Example 1: There is a new file in the working directory that is not committed yet.
  → Git will proceed with the checkout and will keep the uncommitted file as well.
- Example 2: There is an uncommitted change to a file that conflicts with the version of that file in the commit you wish to check out.
  → Git will abort the checkout, and the repo will remain in the current commit.

"""
However, the example 2 may be a bit misleading as it can be understood as the checkout is aborted when file in the working directory is different from the file in the index of the specified commit (the commit we want to checkout to).

The actual checkout abortion mechanism is checkout is aborted if 1) there are certain unsaved (staged or unstaged) changes in the working directory, and 2) git needs to override the content of the file in the process of checkout (i.e., the index of the file at current commit is different from index of the file at the specified commit.)

For example, suppose in our second commit (C2), the content of the file `a.txt` was "a", it has not changed until the fourth commit (C4, and our current commit), and there is an unstaged change to `a.txt`, making its content to be "ab". Then, calling `git checkout` will not abort, and "a.txt" will stay as "ab".

### [Regarding 4.5, `git reset --mixed`]
In this section, the following explanation is given for mixed reset:
"""
**mixed reset**: Cumulative changes from the discarded commits, and any existing staged changes, are moved into the working directory.
"""
This explanation is a bit incomplete as it does not tell us about what happens to the unstaged changes and hence can be understood as cumulative changes from commits and staged changes overriding the working directory.

But the mechanism for mixed reset is as follows:
* `HEAD` is shifted to the specified commit.
* Index is modified to match the Index at the specified commit.
* Working directory remains untouched.

Hence, if the cumulative changes from commits and staged changes were different from the working directory (i.e., if there is unstaged changes), those changes may be dropped (or overriden by the working directory).

Thanks for reading, and if there is anything I am missing or I misunderstood, do let me know. Thanks!

**5. :fas-info-circle: iP/Weekly Tasks Grading Policy**
</div>

Hello, I went through the iP grading criteria and understood that the progress check is done by self-report basis, without test-cases. However, I wasn't sure about how iP is actually graded at the end (how its ultimately graded).

For example, consider "More than 90% of all deliverables" completed criteria. Does it simply take out tags as is, and check whether we have tagged it or not (that is, is it similar to progress check)? Or does it mean someone will be going through the code and commits manually to check (since the outputs are not fixed - e.g., names of chatbot, the output formats, and personalities etc. - it cannot be automated through test cases)? Also, consider "No Major Bugs" criteria. Does this applies only to the final product - that is, if the final product does not have any major bugs then it's fine?

I am bit more confused because I remember the page saying "It's OK to miss a few weekly project deadlines occasionally" and "It's OK to make occasional mistakes in weekly tasks." I was wondering if the projects are checked on self report basis, how we can make "mistakes" except for labelling the tags wrong.

Asking this because I'm a bit afraid I'm missing out anything. Thanks.

Here's my understanding of it. 

git revert is basically creating a new commit that undos changes. You'll still see the commit that you wanted to revert from in history. Resets removes the commit you wanted to undo from history by moving the HEAD (though it is stored somewhere outside of your view for some time.)

For three types of reset, it is easier if you think of what changes to the HEAD, the index, and the working directory.

For soft reset, HEAD moves to the commit you are resetting to, but index and working directory don't change. That's why you have your staged and unstaged changes kept.

For mixed reset, HEAD and index moves to the commit you are resetting to, but working directory remains untouched. That's why you have your changes unstaged (more accurately if you have modified a staged file keeping it unstaged, the staged changes will be dropped.)

For hard reset, HEAD and index moves to the commit you are resetting, and working directory is overwritten by the index. Hence you have a clean working directory with no changes.

Hope it helps.

</div>

Hello, I just want to document a few difference I have noticed between the coding standard and the checkstyle, so that I can confirm it is actually a difference and for future reference as well.

First is lambda style switch statements.
Here's a snippet of my code:
'''<java>
    public Command parseCommand(String userInput) ``{``
        invalidateDelimiter(userInput);

        String[] inputTokens = userInput.trim().split("\\s+");
        String commandWord = inputTokens[0].toLowerCase();

        return switch (commandWord) ``{``
            case "bye" -&gt; parseByeCommand(inputTokens);
            case "list" -&gt; parseListCommand(inputTokens);
            case "mark" -&gt; parseMarkCommand(inputTokens);
            case "unmark" -&gt; parseUnmarkCommand(inputTokens);
            case "todo" -&gt; parseTodoCommand(inputTokens);
            case "deadline" -&gt; parseDeadlineCommand(inputTokens);
            case "event" -&gt; parseEventCommand(inputTokens);
            case "delete" -&gt; parseDeleteCommand(inputTokens);
            case "find" -&gt; parseFindCommand(inputTokens);
            default -&gt; ``{``
                String message = "I'm sorry, but I don't recognize the command provided!";
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(message);
            ``}``
        ``}``;

    ``}``
'''
When running the checkstyle using gradle, here's the relevant part of the error report I get from it:

<img width="393" height="351" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/142010c7-8951-4533-853b-bb480c3f1516" />

I believe it does not allow indentation for all switch statements (including lambdas).

Second is on indentation for wrapped lines.
Here's a snippet of my code:
'''<java>
    public void showSaveDataErrorMessage(String message) ``{``
        String[] errorMessage = ``{``"Oops! We encountered a problem!",
                message,
                "Your task list could not be saved.",
                "Please fix the issue and try again."``}``;
        formatPrint(errorMessage);
    ``}``
'''
Similarly, a relevant part of the error report I get from it:

<img width="575" height="20" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f5487de-ba41-4b06-8855-8932fb1b9683" />

I was following the 8 space rule for the line wrap, but I am not 100% sure of this. So, if you have anything, do let me know.

Thanks.

In my opinion, I think you'll be doing something similar in many different classes, which inherits from a parent class. If you don't want to write too much documentation for such simple method, you can write one for the parent, and put `@inheritDoc` to inherit the parent document. This is given in the java coding standard page.

</div>

With reference to:
> Boolean variables/methods should be named to sound like booleans

in the [Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html)

Does this apply too to a method whose primary function is to manipulate data, and secondary function to return whether the operation is successful?

For example, I have a method `boolean trySaveTransaction()`, which will return `true` if successful and `false` if not. 
- does this violate? It is stated that "As much as possible, use a prefix such as is, has, was, etc. for boolean variable/method names so that linters can automatically verify that this style rule is being followed." However, 'try' makes it "sound boolean"
- is this form of programming discouraged in the first place? A better way might be to return the object being manipulated and `null` if failure, for example.

If that option is not available, post a message in the PR requesting the PR author to update the PR.


I don't understand when this will happen? 

I experimented with a simple case where I create a PR to merge `third` into `main`. 
- there are no merge conflicts
- `main` is ahead of `third` by 2 commits, both commits were made after 53fb. 6738 was made before the PR, and 5a86 was made after. I was not able to observe the out-of-date message after both 6738 and 5a86. 

``` 
* 5a860c5 (HEAD -&gt; main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) Add another new line
* 673822e Add new line
| * 53fb8ca (origin/third, third) Add new msg2

* 2e7caf5 ...

How can files that have not changed be in the staging area? Does this mean:
- Files from previous commits are also in the "index"? Are these files also "in the staging area"?
- Files from previous commits are "tracked" in this commit, even with no changes in this commit? i.e., All files that have been staged and/or commited are counted as tracked by Git.

Not sure if this is relevant, the [Intellij docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_jvm) state:

> Language level: the language level settings are applied for a source root or for a module. If a Gradle project has a single [linked project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#link_gradle_project) then the project default language level is set to the minimum language level among the module language levels. The module language level is set to sourceCompatibility in the build.gradle file.

I am assuming that the language level will be set to what is specified in the build.gradle file whenever the project (or modules, I'm not sure here) is built. This might happen every time it is built, so even if we change the settings back to the original (second pic), a build or sync might revert it to what is specified in `build.gradle`.

Maybe it would be helpful to show the relevant parts in `build.gradle`?

Although not the course's style guide, [this section](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7.3.1-javadoc-exception-self-explanatory) from Google's Java style guide can be referenced for additional perspective.

> Javadoc is optional for "simple, obvious" members and record components, such as a getFoo() method, if there really and truly is nothing else worthwhile to say but "the foo".

> Important: it is not appropriate to cite this exception to justify omitting relevant information that a typical reader might need to know. For example, for a record component named canonicalName, don't omit its documentation (with the rationale that it would say only `@param canonicalName` the canonical name) if a typical reader may have no idea what the term "canonical name" means!

Applying to this case, I would ask if a user of this method is able to infer what it does without looking at the inner code. If no, javadoc is probably preferable.

Thanks everyone for the responses!

Some thoughts:
- Initially, I considered `isTransactionSaved` but thought that it can't capture that the method would mutate data. 
- I missed out using a try-catch approach, having it throw an exception on failure. That seems like the most sensible to me, at least for this case. On second thought, returning a boolean like this will also not be able to capture error message or reason for failure, making it not ideal.

The `Ui` and `Storage` classes will be tightly coupled with the caller class. Using static methods won't be ideal if we want to have dfferent implementations of `promptInput()` or `storeTasks(taskList)` in the future. E.g., we can't just add more variations of `static promptInput()` (maybe `static promptInputSpecial()` for example) into `Ui` as that will be bad OOP and take away benefits of polymorphism, encapsulation, etc. 

You can only have one global state at a time, e.g. TaskList can only hold 1 task list. However, this won't matter if we won't implement multiple lists in the future. 

Sometimes we want to enforce that a method should not be called if no object of the class is constructed yet. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/2671636

To add on to the above, it might be interesting to read into [Strategy Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy). Here, we are essentially interchanging between algorithms depending on the user's input, which makes it a suitable candidate for this specific pattern of implementation. (it is basically what others have mentioned, put more formally)

For example, an implementation might be to add a `CommandExecuter` abstract class, and concrete classes that each have an `execute()` method. Instead of handling logic by itself, `Duke` can delegate logic to these `CommandExecuter` objects by calling their `execute()` method.

'''java
if (commandType.startsWith("mark")) ``{``
    command = new MarkCommandExecuter(args);
``}`` else if (commandType.startsWith("unmark")) ``{``
    command = new UnmarkCommandExecuter(args);
``}`` else if (commandType.startsWith("delete")) ``{``
    command = new DeleteCommandExecuter(args);
``}`` else ``{``
    // Handle other commands
``}``

command.execute(this.tasklist, this.ui, this.storage);
'''


This makes the command handling logic separate from `Duke`, and `Duke.java` will be much more easier to maintain and read through. However, if only little commands exist, it might make the file system hard to navigate as @AK-matrix mentioned.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Similarity of CheckStyle to 2103 Coding Standard**
</div>

Does anyone know how similar the CheckStyle requirements are to the actual coding standard used by the course?

In Week 4 Project Section, the below is mentioned:
> In some areas, the sample Checkstyle rules file ([recommended by the SE-EDU guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html)) may be slightly more permissive/restrictive than (but not contradictory to) the given Java coding standard. You are free to tweak the Checkstyle file if you wish. It is fine as long as your code is compliant with the given coding standard.

However, these differences aren't specified anywhere (afaik), and I want to make sure that my Checkstyle file is atleast as restrictive as the coding standard (at least in terms of the more objective metrics such as indentation, formatting, etc) so that I don't run into any trouble later on.

If your Storage class is written properly, you should be able quite easily to achieve both cases. I would say start with writing the Storage class to be independent so that you can call save() wherever you need.

Trivially, you can achieve case 1 by just performing the Storage.save() on every operation (or only on write operation to reduce disk writes). For case 2, you just perform Storage.save() on the bye command. If you wanted, you could just do both and personally, that seems like the best choice to me.

You should be able to just ignore it and move on, since there is no mentioned requirement for runtest.sh modification. I didn't make any changes either, since I sort of guessed that new features would keep coming in that would need to be tested in a full test.

Sidenote: technically, it shouldn't be ignored even after the JUnit integration, since it seems to me that runtest.sh is meant to be a full end-to-end test, while JUnit is only for unit testing of decoupled components.

I think you could feasibly write a more user-friendly handler to skip over corrupted entries and recover by asking the user to fix it etc., but since it wasn't specified, I just went for the easier solution to output an error and just reinitalize the list. At the end of the day, it's up to you, and I didn't think the chance of corruption was high enough or important enough to warrant writing a more complicated handler for a toy project like this.

Personally, I decoupled `TaskList` and `Storage` so that errors in one wouldn't affect the other (i.e. in this case, errors with the TaskList wouldn't affect Storage). I believe this is generally best practice since it separates the two classes as much as possible and lets us treat the two classes independently.

I think your rationale works fine for the current implementation where `TaskList` is essentially just an `ArrayList` wrapper, but if we did later want to swap out the underlying implementation or interface of `TaskList`, then changes would have to be made to `Storage` as well.

# Description of bug

On the course website page, if the last thing I interact with is a video (play/pause), pressing Cmd + F opens the video in fullscreen instead of triggering the browser’s text search. This feels unexpected and kind of disruptive, as I have to click on anywhere outside the video before I can search for text.

# Expected Behavior

Pressing Cmd + F should always trigger the browser’s Find in Page functionality, regardless of the last interacted element.


# Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the website
2. Click on a video element (play or pause)
3. Press Cmd + F
4. Observe that the video enters fullscreen instead of opening the browser's text search

Adding on to the earlier points, I think it is ok for early stage as it's easy to reference the code logic when there are only a few commands in one place, but if the number of commands is going to increase or the logic itself is complex, then it would be better to abstract out and refactor them into its own file instead

Hey @TehDrink , thanks for helping to clone and debug.

I think I figured out the issue: it's similar to #126 

I had Java 21 on my system before this course and I followed the course's [Mac installation guide of SDKMAN](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) for Java 17.

The issue is every time the IDE/terminal reopens, the Java's version resets to Java 21. After debugging for awhile with ChatGPT... it seems that in `~/.zshrc`, the following 2 line code was added

```
#THIS MUST BE AT THE END OF THE FILE FOR SDKMAN TO WORK!!!
export SDKMAN_DIR="$HOME/.sdkman"
[[ -s "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" ]] && source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

but the terminal does not seem to follow the `sdk default java 17.0.14.fx-zulu` that was set in the guide.

## Commands for checking if SDKMAN works and the current Java version

```
sdk version
java -version
```

## A few workaround based on what I found:

### Solution 1: set those 2 lines of `export SDKMAN...` code in `~/.zprofile`.

convo from ChatGPT:
```
SDKMAN is installed and your .zshrc has the right lines, but zsh is not actually sourcing that .zshrc when Terminal starts.
macOS Terminal login-shell gotcha (very common)
macOS Terminal opens login shells by default, which can change which files are read.
zsh startup order (simplified):
/etc/zshenv
~/.zshenv
~/.zprofile ← login shells
~/.zshrc ← interactive shells
~/.zlogin
Sometimes .zshrc is skipped depending on how Terminal is configured.
✅ Bulletproof fix (recommended)
Add the SDKMAN init also to ~/.zprofile.

Open ~/.zprofile (same way you opened .zshrc) and add:

export SDKMAN_DIR="$HOME/.sdkman"
[[ -s "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" ]] && source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

This ensures SDKMAN loads for login shells too.
Then:
Save
Restart Terminal
```

### Solution 2: run the same installation commands every time IDE/terminal is reopened. commands from: [Mac installation guide of SDKMAN](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html):

```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

it will say 

<img width="737" height="240" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44189f22-3297-46a5-904a-14ac0b40509b" />

and once you run `sdk version`, the SDKMAN is in use when you see:
```
SDKMAN!
script: 5.20.0
native: 0.7.16 (macos aarch64) 
```

instead of `zsh: command not found: sdk`

### Solution 3: update your JAVA_HOME / environment path according to #126 (I have not verified this)

----

If anyone know of any other better ways, feel free to share!

Hi, this seems similar to #126 

could you try running `java -version` to see what's the current Java version you are using?

for context I am a Mac user, but I was looking at the installation guide for Windows @https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html 

Step 5, could your Java 21 be at the top hence it was prioritized?

> To prioritize a different Java version: Find the path to your desired Java installation (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin) and move it to the top of the list.

Hmm how about the `java-version` command being run in your iP folder instead? is it the same?

I think for https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/vscImportingGradleProject.html#step-3-configure-your-jdk, it could be updated to have a section on list of possible/past issues encountered along with the solutions

Also, I didn't know that page existed, I was looking at the https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/admin/ip-w3.html#4-add-increments-a-moreoop-a-packages-a-gradle-a-junit-a-jar and under the `A-Gradle` increment

it was linking to https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html, under the `Adding Gradle to the project` section, I think another tab like `Using VSCode` could be included in there, and link back to https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/vscImportingGradleProject.html#step-3-configure-your-jdk 

Just some thoughts, as it seems like quite a number of students are using VSCode if not IntelliJ?

Hi @breezuu , thanks for the suggestion! This workaround indeed works but it means I have to change my default system `Find...`, which would affect all websites, even though the issue only occur on this course's website.

I believe `Cmd + F` is a universally expected browser shortcut for Find in Page, and I was wondering if this course's website might be overriding it as other websites do not have this issue, e.g. YouTube's full-screen shortcut is the `F` key and `Cmd + F` does not get affected

Hi,

Based on my understanding of the question, this is what we are expected to do. The input file contains only the default input, and the task explicitly requires using input/output redirection to semi-automate testing of the SUT, rather than relying on manual testing.

You can view and restore previous versions of a file by right-clicking the file and selecting **_Local History → Show History_**. This will display the file’s edit history. However, I have not used this feature extensively for long-term history, so I am not certain how far back the changes can be traced.

Let's consider a file empty.txt that is initially committed empty and pushed to the remote repository. After adding the line "hi" and committing locally, performing a revert on the second commit creates a new commit that removes "hi", so the file appears empty locally, while the remote repository remains unchanged until the revert is pushed. A soft reset moves HEAD back to the first commit but keeps "hi" staged, whereas a mixed reset also moves HEAD back but leaves "hi" unstaged while still present in the file. Finally, a hard reset moves HEAD back and discards all changes, restoring the file to its original empty state. These observations are consistent with my experiments during T4L5: Rewriting History to Start Over, which helped clarify the effects of different reset and revert operations.

According to the details provided, the Git Standard task can be successfully completed by ensuring that the repository contains a minimum of 5 commits and that the most recent 5 commit messages fully comply with the Git conventions outlined in the notes. The commit messages should be clear, sufficiently descriptive, and free from any easily identifiable standard violations. 

Please refer to the guidelines outlined [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html) as you may have overlooked some of aspects (such as the use of imperative mood in subject line, limiting the character count to 50 characters, etc).

Hi,

regarding your questions:

a) According to the Level-7 task requirements, the task list can be stored in any file format (e.g. .txt, .csv), as long as it does not require users to install additional software.

b) The file should be stored locally on the user’s machine, since it represents the user’s personal task list rather than shared project data.

Just to chip in, I feel that it may not be very user-friendly for the application to terminate or completely discard all data when the file is corrupted. Doing so could result in users losing all their data and being left confused about what went wrong or what steps to take next. Instead, the application could attempt to recover any valid entries first, and then reinitialise a new Duke.txt file using the recovered data. This approach would improve robustness, as it allows the application to handle partial corruption gracefully rather than failing abruptly on startup.

Based on the image provided and my understanding, the horizontal line between the Attributes and Operations compartments in Class D and Class E is not strictly necessary. However, including the line can enhance clarity by clearly distinguishing the attributes from the operations.

Aside from the following [recommended IntelliJ code style tweaks](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html), I believe that under Editor > Code Style > Java > Wrapping and Braces, one should also replace the default "Do not wrap" with "Wrap if long" for each of the various subsections, e.g.

Without doing this, it seems that performing reformat on IntelliJ (via Ctrl+Alt+L) may not properly wrap lines even if they exceed the hard limit of 120 chars, leading to lines that exceed 120 chars even after reformatting is triggered.

Initially, I thought that these "extension" increments were optional (similar to `A-Enums`, which is explicitly labelled as "if applicable", and shown in the iP Dashboard as an optional item). However, I noticed that many other extension increments are marked as mandatory (e.g. `A-TextUiTesting`, `A-MoreOOP`, `A-Packages`, etc.)

If the aforementioned Week 2 extension increments are intended to be mandatory, perhaps they should be tracked accordingly on the iP Dashboard as well?

In my opinion, it might be better to throw an exception to indicate failure (or success in the absence of an exception) rather than returning a boolean to indicate success. Doing so would force the caller to explicitly handle the failure (since the returned boolean can be easily ignored), and would also allow for richer failure information to be passed to the caller.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Unable to import JavaFX into iP**
</div>

After completing the JavaFX tutorial, I decided to transfer the .java .fxml and .css files over to my iP files along with updating my `build.gradle` file to include the dependencies as instructed in the tutorial.

However after copying everything over and reloading VSCode to ensure by `build.gradle` changes were in effect, none of the JavaFX imports were recognised in any of the files with Visual Studio Code stating that "The import javafx cannot be resolved."

This was in the output panel of VSCode:
```

I was editing my settings.json file as instructed and received this notification from VSCode:

If the extension is truly the source of the problem and I do decide to disable it, will I still be able to use Gradle?

I restored all edited files back to before I attempted to copy any JavaFX related files over into my project and everything worked fine. However when putting the dependencies back into build.gradle, the same error message was returned.
```
* What went wrong:
Could not open cp_init generic class cache for initialization script 'C:\Users\YEOJIA~1\AppData\Local\Temp\97b18158b79a5198b3377caf4b300f06852313eed7a636a3434469cd2df34745.gradle' (C:\Users\Yeo Jian Ming\.gradle\caches\7.6.2\scripts\a3xcgb5qmbsfyaeakcq21zhtm).
> BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '_BuildScript_' Unsupported class file major version 65
```

In fact, editing build.gradle in any way, including removing empty lines, removing dependencies, adding empty lines, all result in the above error message. I have no idea why this could be happening.

Hi @breezuu, thank you for your advice. I swtiched to using version 8.5 for gradle. The import errors have disappeared though they will occasionally show up again without reason before disappearing after a few seconds without me doing anything. Other than that there seems to be no other issues.

After this change, while implementing my JavaFX code into my existing iP, I ran into a similar error as before where it was stating that my MainWindow controller could not be found. Initially I had thought this to be an extension to my prior problem of mismatched Gradle and JDK versions. However I realised that it was because my MainWindow.java file was now in a package and that needed to be reflected in the FXML file.

Thank you @itsapaulblem @Rahulvira @gwhrg @damithc for your responses to my queries. I will be closing this issue.

I've done all the different increment and branch out accordingly for branch-A-CodingStandard. I've the relevant tags and branch in my local Git and did a push to remote as well. However my Git Progress is not turning green even though I've done it?

Based on what you've mentioned i think your understanding is right, as it is similar to what I've understand as followed:

A git revert doesn't remove the original commit but instead creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the previous one. So this means the history actually stays intact, and the remote repo will only reflect this change after the new revert commit is pushed.

As for git reset, the behavior depends on the option used. A --soft reset moves the commit pointer back but keeps the changes staged, so the file will still contain 'hi'. 
A --mixed reset also moves the commit pointer back, but unstages the changes while keeping them in the working directory. Lastly, a --hard reset discards the commit and all local changes, returning the file to its previous empty state.

Hope this helps to clarify your doubts.

> According to the IP dashboard troubleshooting, your branch is ahead by the master by 1? Below is the suggested remedy, I do not know if it will solve your issue.
> 
> "Note the numbers n|m shown for each branch. If the m is not zero, that means the branch is ahead of the master branch by that number of commits, and hence, not considered fully merged (only merged branches are detected by the dashboard). Reasons: You did not push the branch after merging it. Remedy: After merging a branch to the master branch, you need to push both branches to the fork. You pushed commits to the branch after merging it to the master branch. Remedy: Either delete those extra commits from the branch (both locally and in the fork) or merge the branch to the master branch again."

@prickloll right , okay i think that should be the issue i didnt realize it was ahead by 1 commit , i've git merge and and resolve the conflict and git push to master and the remote branch now. It is no longer ahead of master. Will wait for the next Git Progress Update and check on it. Thank you @prickloll @Annazx

As discussed by others earlier, I think the difference in ordering between both when you include `--all` is due to the fact that Git would have to go through all the refs and then show it all in topological order. Perhaps using `--graph` as mentioned earlier may provide a better visualisation of this.

The commit order for `git log --all` follows the same chronological ordering as regular `git log` - it shows commits from most recent to oldest based on commit date.

@Zhang-Jiaxiang0923 Can you share what ordering you're seeing? For example:

Are commits from older dates appearing before newer ones?
What does the output look like (maybe paste a few commit hashes with their dates)?

@Zhang-Jiaxiang0923 I reproduced this on my copy of T4L4 Gitmastery and found the issue. It is linked to what @damithc has mentioned above.

**TL;DR: All commits have the exact same timestamp, so Git's ordering becomes unpredictable without --date-order**

When I run `git log --oneline --all --format="%h %ad %s" --date=iso`,  I get the following result :

```
7b7ae77 2026-01-19 10:52:02 +0800 shapes.txt: Add some shapes
6db165b 2026-01-19 10:52:02 +0800 Add colours.txt, shapes.txt
5eef5cd 2026-01-19 10:52:02 +0800 colours.txt: Add some colours
706a206 2026-01-19 10:52:02 +0800 Add elderberries and figs into fruits.txt
c53a0e2 2026-01-19 10:52:02 +0800 Update fruits list
69154db 2026-01-19 10:52:02 +0800 Add fruits.txt
```

This command tells us the sequence in which Git processes the commits in this repo. Since the repo was initialised instantly via the gitmastery command, all commits share the same timestamp. As mentioned by others above, using `--all` will make Git traverse from multiple refs (main branch + tags 0.9 and 1.0). The identical timestamps means the ordering depends on traversal path and not time itself.

We can confirm this by running `git log --oneline --all` and it gives the same following result:
```
7b7ae77 (HEAD -&gt; main) shapes.txt: Add some shapes
6db165b (tag: 0.9) Add colours.txt, shapes.txt
5eef5cd (tag: 1.0) colours.txt: Add some colours
706a206 Add elderberries and figs into fruits.txt
c53a0e2 Update fruits list
69154db Add fruits.txt
```

To force strict chronological order (which in this case will just becomes topological order since all timestamps are the same), you can try `git log --oneline --all --date-order`. This gives us the expected result:

```
7b7ae77 (HEAD -&gt; main) shapes.txt: Add some shapes
5eef5cd (tag: 1.0) colours.txt: Add some colours
c53a0e2 Update fruits list
6db165b (tag: 0.9) Add colours.txt, shapes.txt
706a206 Add elderberries and figs into fruits.txt
69154db Add fruits.txt
```

The Checkstyle-IDEA plugin and Checkstyle library are separate but related. The plugin bundles specific Checkstyle versions. Since version 11.0.0 isn't listed, I used 11.0.1 instead, which is a compatible patch version of 11.0.0 and should work correctly with the project's configuration. It works for me locally.

Another approach is to use `Platform.exit()` with an exit flag, which is what I did, similar to what @hxckjian suggested:
'''java
private void handleUserInput() ``{``
    String input = userInput.getText();
    String response = alphaOne.getResponse(input);
    dialogContainer.getChildren().addAll(
            DialogBox.getUserDialog(input, userImage),
            DialogBox.getDukeDialog(response, dukeImage)
    );
    userInput.clear();

    if (alphaOne.isExit()) ``{``
        Platform.exit();
    ``}``
``}``
'''

`Platform.exit()` will properly shut down the JavaFX application and close all windows.

If you want users to see the farewell message before the window closes, you can add a pause transition like @Lim-ZY showed:
'''java
if (alphaOne.isExit()) ``{``
    PauseTransition pause = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(1));
    pause.setOnFinished(e -&gt; Platform.exit());
    pause.play();
``}``
'''

This keeps the logic layer (of your chatbot) responsible for determining when to exit, while the UI handles how to close the window.

As @Yixiannya said, you should also try disabling indent detection in IntelliJ IDEA. Sometimes the auto-detect feature can override your configured code style settings.

**Steps:**
1. Go to `File > Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences` on macOS)
2. Navigate to `Editor > Code Style`
3. Uncheck **"Detect and use existing file indents for editing"**
4. Also uncheck **"Enable EditorConfig support"** if you don't have an `.editorconfig` file

After disabling these, try reformatting your code (`Ctrl+Alt+L` / `Cmd+Option+L`) to see if the cases align properly with the switch statement.

IntelliJ's code style settings likely don't have granular enough controls for switch expressions specifically (as opposed to traditional switch statements), so it may be treating them differently. As a workaround, you could try formatter comments:
```
// @formatter:off
Task task = switch (params[0]) ``{``
case "T" -&gt; ``{`` ... ``}``
...
``}``;
// @formatter:on
```

Deaf Prof, I would like to clarify if it is standard practice in this course to include JavaDoc comments for JUnit tests as well (in particular, for increment A-JavaDoc)?

From my own understanding and Googling, I think the answer is no, because
1. You wouldn't expect users to be digging around and looking for documentation for testing functions (if they are even public in the first place).
2. The testcases are meant to be named and written in an easy-to-read and -understand way, hence if other developers were to look at its code, they would understand it well.

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡Unexpected error when downloading Git-Mastery exercises**
</div>

Git-Mastery offers sandbox creation for exercises, using the command `gitmastery download &lt;exercise name>`.

Personally, when I run this command, it terminates in an error, which upon tracing the error message, is caused by the command `git clone &lt;other stuff> --sparse &lt;more stuff>` throwing an error along the lines of "no command named `--sparse`". (I restarted my terminal so I don't have the specific error message and output unfortunately.)

This happened due to my `git` not being updated, as sparse is a relatively new flag.

The fix is also quite simple, to update git. I'm on Mac, so the command is
`brew update`, followed by
`brew upgrade git`

Interestingly, `brew upgrade git` might throw another error saying git is not installed, because Apple comes with its own default git installation. If this happens, just to `brew install git`, then restart your terminal.

Ultimately, `git --version` should return 2.52.0, instead of my previous 2.17.0.

Since this error was not mentioned in the Git-Mastery page, and it took me some Googling to resolve, just thought to put this out here in case anyone else needs it. :D

Another way to motivate the "non-need" to throw and catch unchecked exceptions comes from CS2030S, in the notes here: https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2425-s1/22-exception.html#unchecked-exceptions

Unchecked errors like `IndexOutOfBoundsException` should never occur if the perfect programmer checks all indices before retrieving elements from that index, but no programmer can anticipate, at the time of coding, if a certain file (whose filename is given by a user) will be found on disk. Hence, checked exceptions such as `FileNotFoundException` have to be handled, by using exception handling code.

Hence, to answer your question about throwing and checking unchecked exceptions, if I were to write code to throw/catch unchecked exceptions, I would question why that exception would arise in the first place and add if-guards (e.g. checking if a variable is non-null before unpacking it).

Just my two cents :)

To share my personal take on this:

1. The motivation of languages even having errors and try-catch mechanisms is to allow programs to anticipate and react to errors when they inadvertently occur. I understand their purpose to be to help guide users into correct inputs, hide ugly implementation details and more importantly, ensure continuous running of the program. Hence, terminating the program and requiring the user to start all over again sounds rather counter intuitive.

2. As the project scales up, there could be a lot more potential errors you would need to catch, and while you could lump everything into a generic `InvalidArgumentException` with different messages, eventually you would run into a problem of wanting to catch a specific error but not another, and finding yourself unable to do so (as you can only filter by exception type, not its actual message). Ultimately there are different Exception classes that are used for specific errors, e.g. `FileNotFoundException` and `NullPointerException` are very different and would likely be handled differently. The same (eventually, I assume, as we iteratively progress in the iP) can be said about exceptions specific to the Duke chatbot.

This is intended for those who use jdt.ls as the java language server in their setup.

Sometimes, jdt.ls may show errors that your package definition does not match your file location. This seems to be related to jdt.ls wrongly constructed the classpath in its data folder. Here is how to fix it:

1. First, navigate to the jdt.ls data folder. [On my windows machine, it turns out to be `%APPDATA%\jdtls\jdtls-xxxxxxxxxxx`.]
1. Then navigate to your project dir. [Would be something like `ip_4c02b380`].
1. There is a `bin` folder. In this folder, arrange the `.class` files into the same directory structure as your `.java` files in your project.
1. Then open the `.classpath` file, delete all other entries with `&lt;classpathentry kind="src" path=.../>` except for `&lt;classpathentry kind="src" path="_/src/main/java"/>`.
1. Then it should work.

Hopefully this can help those encountering the same issue.

maybe like change 0,1 to -2,-1 so it would not complain about being incomplete if someone accidentally fast forwarded for the first merge? or to be more sophiscated, count in other operations like reset and etc to find out the actual two merging operations?

Does this mean that patterns without / can only match files? If so, then the wording on the second rule could be modified by removing "/folders".

I have done some research from https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore.

> The slash `/` is used as the directory separator. Separators may occur at the beginning, middle or end of the .gitignore search pattern.
> 
> If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern, then the pattern is relative to the directory level of the particular .gitignore file itself. Otherwise the pattern may also match at any level below the .gitignore level.
> 
> If there is a separator at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only match directories, otherwise the pattern can match both files and directories.

My understanding from this
Case 1: Pattern has `/` at the beginning or middle
The pattern is relative to the location of .gitignore, so only that specific file path will match.

Case 2: Pattern does not have `/` at the beginning or middle
The pattern can match anywhere in the project folder, meaning the search is done recursively.

If the pattern has `/` at the end, only directories will be matched.
If the pattern does not have `/` at the end, both files and directories will be matched.
Note: files need to be named exactly the last word before `/` (no file extensions) in order to be matched

example

- `/dir1/dir2/` or `dir1/dir2/` would match the directory named `dir2` which is in the directory `/dir1`
- `/dir1/dir2` or `dir1/dir2` would match files or directories named dir2 which is in the directory `/dir1`
- `dir1/` would match any directory named `dir1`
- `dir1` would match any files or directories named `dir1`

A possible update to the tutorial could be:
- Add a trailing `/` to match directories
'''bash
logs/             # Ignores all directories named logs
'''

- Patterns without trailing `/` match both files and directories
'''bash
logs              # Ignores all files and directories named logs
'''

- Patterns without `/` match both files and directories recursively
'''bash
*.bak             # Ignores all .bak files anywhere
'''

- Patterns with non-trailing `/` are relative to the `.gitignore` location
'''bash
secret/file.txt   # Only ignores file.txt in the /secret directory
'''

**1. :fas-info-circle: Javadoc header confusion**
</div>


In the Java coding standard, it is mentioned that getters/setters may be exempt from javadoc headings. However, what if it is a slightly modified getter instead of a direct one? 
For example, I have a Task function that returns a String "[X]" if the task is done, "[ ]" otherwise. Is it considered getter enough to be exempt?

Are we allowed to use text blocks? The Java coding standard only mentions not breaking hard line limit of 120 characters.

For IP Level-5, are we supposed to terminate the program after an error occured (by throwing exception), or merely display an error message but continue running the program?

**4. :fas-info-circle: Confusion over revert and reset**
</div>



Hi, I'm a bit confused about the git commands of revert and reset, so I'm asking this to confirm my understanding:
Let's say I have a local file empty.txt, I stage and commit it in my local repo, push it to a remote repo, add one line "hi" to it, then stage and commit it in my local repo again.
Am I right to say that:

1. Reverting the commit will basically make a new commit that erases the line in my local repo, but not in the remote repo until it (the new commit) is pushed. When I open the txt locally now, it will be empty.
2. A soft reset will be as if I staged the changes, but haven't committed it yet. Opening the txt after a soft reset will show "hi".
3. A mixed reset will be as if I added "hi", but haven't staged or committed it. Opening the txt will show "hi".
4. A hard reset will erase changes everywhere, and opening the txt will show an empty file.

Thank you!

Then, on the filters, you can search your name for the pr
E.g. [NigelGM]

Click on your own pull request
You should be able to see the image below

For this:
'''java
scrollPane.vvalueProperty().bind(dialogContainer.heightProperty());
'''
vvalue is turned into a bound property. When the user tries to change vvalue by scrolling, the binding forces it back to a certain value. Hence, scrolling doesn't appear to do anything.

The second approach:
'''java
Platform.runLater(() -&gt; scrollPane.setVvalue(1.0));
'''
does not bind vvalue. After each user input, the VBox height doesn’t update immediately. `Platform.runLater(...)` makes it update at the next layout pass, once `scrollPane` knows the new scroll range. So both user scroll and auto-scroll are preserved.

Yeap i agree with the understanding of the 3 types of resets here!

From what I understand:
1. Soft Reset leaves staging and working directory unchanged and moves HEAD back a few commits by what you specified (can be used to squash commits by re-committing them as one
2. Mixed reset will leave your work in the working directory but unstaged (could be used in some cases, like if you change your mind to commit it in small chunks as patches)
3. Hard reset does overwrite the working directory to match the target commit.

I agree with the point above on communicating intent. The choice sort of acts as implicit documentation for anyone reading the code too!

Using a static method usually signals that the operation is self-contained and stateless, whereas instantiating an object usually signals that there is meaningful state being tracked (like the example with Storage or TaskList).

If we make stateful classes static, the state persists in the class itself rather than a specific instance, which may not be what we want when it comes to testing of the different classes such as the storage class!

According to the IP dashboard troubleshooting, your branch is ahead by the master by 1? Below is the suggested remedy, I do not know if it will solve your issue. 

"Note the numbers n|m shown for each branch. If the m is not zero, that means the branch is ahead of the master branch by that number of commits, and hence, not considered fully merged (only merged branches are detected by the dashboard). Reasons:
You did not push the branch after merging it.
Remedy: After merging a branch to the master branch, you need to push both branches to the fork.
You pushed commits to the branch after merging it to the master branch.
Remedy: Either delete those extra commits from the branch (both locally and in the fork) or merge the branch to the master branch again."

I agree with this. I believe if you aren’t planning to store any form of data in your class, you should just use static methods in that class, where the data passed into the method is used only for that method. However, if you see yourself passing in the same data into multiple methods, it’s better if you use a class with non-static methods because you creating a class with multiple static methods is pretty much equivalent to functional programming and defeats the purpose of OOP

**1. :fas-info-circle: Gitmastery T2L5 hp-update-remote is not linked to remote**
</div>

Hi, `hp-update-remote` is provided as Option 1 to "HANDS-ON: Pushing to send further updates to a repo", but it is not linked/tracked to the remote repo.

In contrast, the hp-populate-remote/things repo in Option 2 would've been manually tracked at this point in the exercise.

Can I check whether this is considered a bug, as Option 1 is missing instructions to first `git push` the hp-update-remote/things main branch to remote origin?

Thanks!

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡 Resolving failed to get: -128 error for GitMastery T2L5 hp-populate-remote**
</div>

**TL;DR: If git push fails, good to check that the URL in .git/config matches your SSH/HTTPS auth method.**

---

While attempting the T2L5 hands-on (hp-populate-remote), I faced the following issue:

1. `git push -u origin main`
2. macOS keychain password prompt appears: <img width="502" height="247" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0bed567-9387-4fa6-b7c0-2203bd428987" />
3. Entering the correct password results in this error:
```
remote: Permission to wesley-pribadi/gitmastery-things.git denied to wesley-pribadi.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/wesley-pribadi/gitmastery-things/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

The problem is that the `.git/config` setup by `gitmastery download hp-populate-remote` uses HTTPS URL and I am authenticated to `gh` using SSH instead, so auth fails.

Editing `hp-populate-remote/things/.git/config` to use my SSH URL resolves the error.

Just thought I'd put this out in case anyone else using SSH auth faces this error!

---

Was also curious how gitmastery sets up the config files... Perhaps it could detect the auth method and setup the config accordingly?

Hi, ~~you can add unchanged files to staging area as such~~: `git stage .` or `git stage changed_file.txt unchanged_file.txt`.

EDIT: Unchanged files are not considered to be in the staging area, but they are committed nonetheless. Can refer to @elijah-ng's comment below.

I think the paragraph is simply trying to be clear that when doing `git commit`, even unchanged_file.txt is commited, hence we should be aware that all files in the staging area are committed and not just the changes/delta.

Does this help?

I already have 'Indent 'case' branches' set to false for ''switch' statement/expression, but IDEA still keeps indenting the cases - causing them to fail checkstyle.

Hi all, none of the suggestions appear to have worked. On the other hand, I am confident that the issue is not to do with the return but rather with the enhanced switch expression as the following code is also indented wrongly:

'''java
        Task task = switch (params[0]) ``{``
            case "T" -&gt; ``{``
                if (params.length != 3) ``{``
                    throw new InvalidTaskParameterException();
                ``}``

                yield new Todo(params[2]);
            ``}``
            case "D" -&gt; ``{``
                if (params.length != 4) ``{``
                    throw new InvalidTaskParameterException();
                ``}``

                yield new Deadline(
                        params[2],

Yes, I believe your understanding is correct! Here's what I understand:

### Git Reset
For `git reset <commit>`, it basically moves your current branch and `HEAD` pointer to the commit you specify. Like the others mentioned, there are 3 flags that we are taught:
- `--soft` : Moves `HEAD` but leaves your changes staged.
- `--mixed`: Default flag if no flag specified. Moves `HEAD` but leaves your changes unstaged.
- `--hard` : Moves `HEAD` and discards all changes you made. 

For example, 
```
git status // A. no changes at all. current commit: 7b1e4d9
echo "Hi" >> existingFile.txt // B. unstaged
git add existingFile.txt // C. staged
git commit -m "Add text to existingFile.txt" // creates a new commit a3f5c9e
```
```
// what each command would do, current commit: a3f5c9e
git reset --soft HEAD~1 // back to state like C (changes staged); current commit: 7b1e4d9
git reset HEAD~1 // back to state like B (changes unstaged); current commit: 7b1e4d9
git reset --hard HEAD~1 // back to state like A (clean); current commit: 7b1e4d9
```

### Git Revert
For `git revert <commit>`, you correctly pointed out that it creates a new commit that undoes the specified commit. 
For example,
```
echo "Hi" >> existingFile.txt // B. unstaged
git add existingFile.txt // C. staged
git commit -m "Add text to existingFile.txt" // creates a new commit a3f5c9e
// You make a few more commits
git revert a3f5c9e // This creates a new commit 7b1e4d9 that removes "Hi" from existingFile.txt
```

*Note:* Both of these commands apply to your local repository. But they differ in their behaviour when you push. Changes from `git revert` is safe to push to your remote repository because it does not rewrite history but just creates a new commit. But `git reset`rewrites history. So if you want to push changes from `git reset`, you'd need to use `git push --force`. But it's not safe if you have other collaborating on the repository because if they `git pull` (fetch + merge) before you force pushed the changes, then others would have a different history locally and it just snowballs. So if you're working in teams, it is better to do `git revert`.

Yes, I think it was meant to convey that for Java switch statements, there should not be a trailing whitespace after the colon for the `case` keyword. 
'''java
switch (condition) ``{``
    case x:// &lt;- no white space 
        statement
        break;
``}``
'''
To be safe, just follow the coding standard for switch statements [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#:~:text=The%20switch%20statement%20should%20have%20the%20following%20form).

Based on my understanding, a class can be represented just by its class name. You can refer to this [exercise question](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/modeling.html#:~:text=Which%20classes%20are%20correct?) as I found it helpful!

To answer your second question, I agree with your conclusion.

On a separate note, I think you brought up a good point:
> If compartments may be omitted, and the attributes/operations themselves can also be omitted if deemed irrelevant to the purpose of the diagram,

In the end, I think it boils down to how you use the UML diagram. So while a certain design choice is valid, the key question is how the diagram's level of detail helps us. Personally, I would think it is best to be more detailed to reduce ambiguity.

I managed to fix the issue by doing `./gradlew clean build` then `./gradlew clean run`, instead of `./gradlew clean build` then `./gradlew run`. Not sure why this was the case, but the issue has been resolved.

Building on the points above, I think the key question is how we view `TaskList`. If it’s just a thin wrapper over a collection, then returning either a generic list or a `TaskList` doesn’t really change much.

If we instead treat `TaskList` as a more meaningful object, I’d still prefer having `Storage` return a generic collection. That keeps `Storage` focused only on reading data, and makes it easier to change or evolve `TaskList` later without needing to touch the storage code. It also makes testing `Storage` simpler, since it doesn’t depend on higher-level behaviour.

The domain logic and checks can still live fully inside `TaskList` once it’s constructed, so the separation stays clear.

Did this start after the package increment? If so, it’s likely related.

When a class is moved into a package, its fully qualified name changes. If the run configuration wasn’t updated, IntelliJ will still try to run the class using the old name and fail.

You can try closing the run configuration and running the class directly from the file. IntelliJ should regenerate the configuration with the correct class name.

As mentioned above, I agree this approach makes sense here given the number and variety of commands involved. In cases where commands remain very small and uniform, though, introducing many separate command classes can add structural overhead, making the codebase harder to navigate without much practical gain.

**1. :fas-info-circle: [JavaFX tutorial] image embedding inconsistencies**
</div>

Small nit. I realised that some images (refer to 1st image) were embedded on the tutorial page, while some were clickable (refer to 2nd image) and opened up as another page which might cause some navigatability issues. I'm not sure whether this was intentional because the original image was already quite big on the screen. There was also an occasional issue where after i accidentally clicked on the photo and navigated back to the original page, it would lose track of progress and i had to scroll all the way back down to continue where i left off.

**1. :fas-info-circle: [Gitmastery] Local progress also deleted when running `gitmastery progress sync on` or `off` while accessing `progress` folder from another terminal**
</div>

When running the command `gitmastery progress sync on` or `off` while simultaneously accessing the `progress` folder in another terminal, the local `progress.json` is unexpectedly deleted. **(EDIT: see each Steps to Reproduce section for behaviours)** ~~in addition to the remote repo (fork) being deleted (expected).~~

**(Note about OneDrive)** My file path contains "OneDrive" but my files are not actually being synced to OneDrive. This is because years ago, I deleted OneDrive from my computer, but I continued to use the underlying folder structure for all local files.

### Steps to Reproduce (`sync off`)

1. Make sure progress sync is already enabled
2. Open Command Prompt and change the cwd to the `gitmastery-exercises/progress` folder
3. Open Git Bash and change the cwd to the gitmastery root folder `gitmastery-exercises`
4. On Git Bash, run `gitmastery progress sync off`
5. Confirm when prompted

After performing the above steps, an exception occurred. ~~The progress folder was empty and the remote on GitHub was deleted.~~ **(EDIT: clarification)** The remote on GitHub was deleted, which is expected. The `progress` folder was empty, which is unexpected. The expected behaviour is that `progress.json` remains.

See the log file at the bottom of this issue, starting from `[2026-01-27 18:55:30,756]`. The output on Git Bash is shown below.

```

### Steps to Reproduce (`sync on`)

1. Make sure the `progress` folder exists and `progress.json` is inside it. (I moved a backup `progress.json` inside after running the steps for `sync off`)
2. Open Command Prompt and change the cwd to the `gitmastery-exercises/progress` folder
3. Open Git Bash and change the cwd to the gitmastery root folder `gitmastery-exercises`
4. On Git Bash, run `gitmastery progress sync on`
5. Enter your passphrase to create the fork and clone it

After performing the above steps, an exception occurred. ~~A fork was indeed created on GitHub, but the local progress folder was empty.~~ **(EDIT: clarification)** A fork was created on GitHub, which is expected. The `progress` folder was empty, which is unexpected. The expected behaviour is that `progress.json` remains.

On gitmastery v7.6.0 (latest now) I can consistently replicate OP's issue with these steps: after running `gitmastery progress sync on`, repeatedly enter the wrong password when the dialog box pops up. Traceback is identical to OP's. The progress folder and its contents are deleted.

I believe `progress sync on` works fine now, after trying a few different configurations:

- Running the command when sync is initially off vs already on
- Failing passphrase checks at different points

Unfortunately I found a different way to delete progress. I'll open a separate issue.

Hmm i dont think that extra line is supposed to be there. In UML class diagrams, horizontal lines are only used to separate valid compartments such as the class name, attributes, and operations. Since Class D has no attributes, the operations section should appear directly under the class name with a single separating line. The additional line does not have any UML meaning and is best treated as a diagram formatting error rather than a rule to follow. Correct me if i'm wrong

Interesting. lambda expressions should still follow the same “Egyptian brackets” (K&R) and wrapping rules, because they are just another kind of block/statement in Java. Not sure why your example 1 fails the style checker, but maybe it could be due to the lambda block? 

A clean, commonly accepted approach that usually satisfies CheckStyle is to avoid a block lambda when you don’t need it, personally i always try to avoid these. You can replace your code with the below, see if the error goes away.
@Test
public void deserialiseTask_invalidTodo_exceptionThrown() ``{``
    assertThrows(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class,
            () -&gt; Storage.deserialiseTask("T|0"));

Sorry to bother everyone, but could anyone tell me, if I fail to fulfill the Git convention requirement, how should I know which comments I need to modify, or what can I do to meet the requirement?

I have notified that it requires the last 5 commits' comments to follow the convention. So is it I only need to post new commit messages?

Thank you very much.

(I have definitely commented more than 5 commits).

By the way, could anyone help me check which of my commit messages is causing the trouble? I personally thought they were all fine. Thank you!

1. Update EXPECTED.TXT to match the new testing inputs
2. Add JavaDoc comments for new classes and methods
3. Merge branch 'branch-Level-9'

Thank you very much for your quick help! But I am still confused about how can I fulfill the git convention again. Do I just update new commit message and then it will count from my new messages?

Hi, do you have multiple Java versions installed? By default, Gradle uses the same JVM that it is running on to build the project, unless configured otherwise. Since this project does not specify anything in build.gradle,[ Gradle simply falls back to the Gradle JVM](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html). Thats why Eclipse Temurin 17.0.12 is used. Since Gradle is in use, IntelliJ’s own Project SDK setting is not in effect for building, as IntelliJ is not the one performing the build.

You can use `gradlew.bat -version` to check what JVM is Gradle running on.
```
.\gradlew.bat -version

I usually just use non-static class whenever it's available since it is more flexible. 

Here is a table that I use when deciding which to use:
```
| Qn                                             | Yes        | No         |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| Does it hold state?                            | Non-static | Next qn    |
| Might I need more than one version later?      | Non-static | Next qn    |
| Does it interact with IO / files / user input? | Non-static | Next qn    |
| Is it just a pure helper function?             | Static     | Non-static |
```
In short, just start with non-static. Make it static only if you’re 100% sure it should never change.

I think returning a `TaskList` from Storage seems to be good use of OOP. Since other parts of the app do not have to know that tasks are stored in an `ArrayList`. They only need a list of tasks with a direct API(add, get, remove, size, etc.) which is what `TaskList` is. If Storage returns `ArrayList`, every caller has to depend on that type. If you are switching to another structure later on(e.g. another list implementation or a different abstraction), you have to change all those calls to that method. If Storage returns `TaskList`, only Storage (and `TaskList`'s internals) need to know the actual data structure so changes only have to be made there.

Hey! I had the same thought. While static is definitely faster to write, I decided to use non-static (instance) classes for components like Ui and Storage for flexibility. I realized that if I kept them non-static, I could swap them out later more easily. Whereas if everything was static, the code would be 'hard-wired' to those specific classes, making it harder to test.

From my understanding, index contain all the entries of all the files, so whenever u commit it tracks all the changed and unchanged files using the index(in the staging area) 

And yes, files in the index are tracked by git(even with no changes in this commit), so git will include it in the next snapshot

So when u git add u kind of update the entries then when u git commit git just look at the entries

Ahh i missed the grey line thanks for reminding

I guess if we place "import all other imports" above "import module imports", then "import module imports" will become redundant and therefore follows the suggested style

For ease of discussion, here is the code block from the debrief:

    if (XmlFormat.length() &lt; expected) ``{``
        return true;
    ``}`` else ``{``

The coding standard violations mentioned in the debrief were: 
1. boolean variable name should be binary sounding (e.g. `isSend`)
2. `XmlFormat` should be in camelCase 

However, since method names should be verbs, would naming a method `length()` also be a coding standard violation? A name that follows coding standards could be `getLength()`.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Utilising OOP principles in class method design**

After doing the OOP commit in the iP, I now have a `Storage` class which implements a `loadTasks()` method, that can read from disk. At first, I thought this method should return a generic data structure (e.g. `ArrayList&lt;Task>`). However, I realised I could also package it in my `TaskList` class, and return that instead.  

My instinct is that I should hide the generic data structure under `TaskList`, because that's the object class I've designated as a task collection. Nonetheless, I'm happy to hear everyone's thoughts on which option better utilises OOP principles.

Thanks to everyone for their comments! It has been an engaging discussion with support for both sides. To summarise: 

### In favour of returning an `ArrayList`:
* Decouples `Storage` and `TaskList`, so that method changes to `TaskList` may not incur changes in `Storage`, and testing `Storage` is easier (e.g. no need to create stubs). 

### In favour of returning a `TaskList`:
* `TaskList` functions as an API which keeps implementation details hidden, good use of abstraction. 
* Avoids the need to propagate change: if we return an `ArrayList`, all callers of `loadTask()` have to know about the `ArrayList`, which is messy.
* One can also take a `TaskList` as input to `loadTasks()`, or use an instance of `Storage` in `TaskList`.

Hi, CS2103T students are not required to bid for a tutorial slot.

Reference: [Course Website Week 1 Announcements](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/schedule/week1/index.html)

[CS2103T Students] (not applicable to CS2103):

- Of the many weekly sessions that appear under CS2103T, only two actually belong to CS2103T. Those are, the lecture slot on Friday 1600-1800, and the 1-hour tutorial slot. The other 3-hour slots belong to the CS2101 course. All CS2101 sessions start in week 1.

- **There is no need for you to bid for a CS2103T tutorial slot in the upcoming tutorial selection exercise -- the 1-hour CS2103T slot (mis-labelled as 'lecture') in your timetable is your tutorial slot.**

Just making a guess that the stylechecker checks for line breaks after ``{`` curly braces, no matter where it is placed. In your use case in your given Examples, perhaps there is no need for curly braces since there is only one statement so we do not need a whole code block?

Seek the input of others regarding the first checkstyle violation though, the one on "'(' should be on the previous line. [SeparatorWrap]. This refers to the left bracket of the lambda expression". I have tried adjusting it but no matter where it is placed, be it in the line before or after, my IDE automatically formats it to this:

```
@Test
public void deserialiseTask_invalidTodo_exceptionThrown() ``{``
    assertThrows(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class,
            () -&gt; Storage.deserialiseTask("T|0"));
``}``
```

EDIT: I feel more comfortable sticking with this current style, and will be removing this check from the checkstyle.

If you follow everything closely, at least up to Part 4, everything will be set up very nicely for you.
My GUI is only modified slightly after Part 4, just to add some aesthetics, and to also fix the anchor issue (very simple if you use SceneBuilder)

The question is for Using Checkstyle-IDEA plugin
The website says that ‘Ensure that the Checkstyle version is set to the one used by the project.
 If your project uses Gradle, you can check the build.gradle file to find the correct version.’
However, when I checked build.gradle, I found the version should be 11.0.0, but there's no such option:

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡Fix mouse scrolling issue in GUI**
</div>

Hello everyone, I would like to share a fix to an issue that I noticed, with regards to mouse scrolling in the GUI.

Previously, I had noticed that upon booting up the program, the chat history was unresponsive to scrolling with the mouse, even after we click on the pane. However, after manually scrolling with the scroll bar, we are then finally able to scroll with the mouse.

To solve this, we can make the following changes. Instead of having this method:

'''java
@FXML
public void initialize() ``{``
    scrollPane.vvalueProperty().bind(dialogContainer.heightProperty());
``}``
'''

we can instead add the following line to the end of the `handleUserInput()` method:

'''java
// autoscroll downwards after the new message bubbles have been added
Platform.runLater(() -&gt; scrollPane.setVvalue(1.0));
'''

and the issue is solved.

In the new code, the adjustment of the vvalue is made after each user input, thus preserving the downwards autoscroll. However, I'm not too sure why the previous code led to the mouse scrolling problem, nor do I understand why the new code solves the issue. Would anyone be able to offer an explanation? Thank you!

Hello everyone, would like to share my GUI. Here are some pointers that I have implemented:

- Use polymorphism to distinguish between different kinds of messages that can be produced by the chatbot: `SuccessMessage`, `WarningMessage` and `ErrorMessage`, all inheriting from the base `Message` class. These messages will be formatted differently, according to its type. For example, `Message` is blue,  `SuccessMessage` is green, `WarningMessage` is yellow and `ErrorMessage` is red
- Display an initial `WarningMessage` if there is some issue during the loading of existing tasks
- Use different formats to parse dates in input and display dates in output
- Show informative `ErrorMessage`s. For example, the user is directed to a list of known commands, should an invalid command be issued

</div>


Hi Prof @damithc ,

Our team has some questions regarding the tP, particular given the evolve constraint of the addressbook. We have generated many ideas but we wanted to clarify whether some of these ideas fit the "evolve" constraint:

1) Rather than contact details of "People", we considered storing places (E.g. Food/Travel destinations), for people to keep this as a record for future use. Mainly, the question here is whether or not the new address book has to explicitly store People and their contact details.
2) We have some other ideas which do fit the same purpose of keeping people's contact details for tracking. But we were also wondering whether, if the address/contact details is not really the primary purpose, would it be acceptable. E.g. The user does use the address but the main focus of the addressbook is for example, keep tracking of finances, tags, etc.

Hi, apart from the really great points raised, I think the difference or choice between using static and non-static class becomes clearer if you think about how other people read and understand your code.

Creating an instance and non-static methods associated with it is communicating to the reader/others who are using your code that there is a supposed state that you will be manipulating within the instance. They might expect that this instance would hold meaningful data. Rather, if you use a static method, it is more simple and it tells people that there is no instance to be tracked and it is simply a self-contained operation. Creating a redundant object instance would mislead readers and also create unnecessary code.

Similarly, if a class contains static and non-static methods, it depends on whether you are manipulating the state within the instance object to be created. Non-static for state manipulation and static otherwise.

If we follow the kind of working stated in the coding standard I think it doesn't align. Like what @prickloll said perhaps isTransactionSaved() would be better. I guess another way to think about your specific example would be try/catch blocks? You wouldn't consider a try/catch block to be a "boolean function" either

Windows Operating systems use backslash, but in human typing, we use a forward slash. I don't think it is a typo since Windows OS usually understands or converts to backslash. Usually, when you specify a forward slash directory, it is converted to a backslash in display, so either convention is technically not wrong

Additionally, for Unix/Linux uses forward slash, I think the instruction is assuming us as users to be in Windows, which might be why they used backslash

I think it is sort of known that Constructors should follow the naming convention of the Class. Meaning that the constructor should also be PascalCase. You can also see that the checkstyle script you run with Gradle also allows your constructor to be in PascalCase

I'd use 'isTransactionSaved()' for something I expect a T/F for, and consider 'tryTransactionSave()' for something  I might want to try catch on. But honestly, if i want to do that it probably signals a possible mutation/error so 'useTransaction()' alone would have been best.

But just for sake of clarity since I'd think most people agree that isX sounds the most boolean, it might just be better to stick with that.

Hey Ram, having `logs` and `logs/` in `.gitignore` will refer to the same thing. 
There can only be 1 instance of `log`, whether it is a directory or a file. 
```
jedeon@JDFedora:~/temp$ mkdir asdf
jedeon@JDFedora:~/temp$ touch asdf
jedeon@JDFedora:~/temp$ ls
asdf
jedeon@JDFedora:~/temp$ ll
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 1 jedeon jedeon 0 Jan 23 17:08 asdf
```

Additionally, 
```
logs              # Ignores all files and directories named logs
*.bak             # Ignores all .bak files anywhere
```
would be the same thing execution, just that `.bak` would be more of Regex usecase

The only use case i could foresee would be when the user does not know whether logs is a directory or a file (which i think will be quite rare haha)

Coming from a video game perspective (Pokémon),
When the game notices a corrupted save file, it loads a backup of the last save while prompting the user that the current save file is corrupted. Although unfortunate the first save file cannot be recovered, at least there is a secondary backup that the user can load backup as a last resort.
Perhaps its something worth pondering about!

To add on to the above answers, one way to keep things cleaner is to let the logic layer signal that an exit is required, and let the UI decide how to close the window.

For example, my duke (neko) has an exit flag (e.g. hasExited()), which the UI checks after handling user input.

Rough sketch of my ```handleUserInput```:
```
private void handleUserInput() ``{``
    String input = userInput.getText();

    dialogContainer.getChildren().addAll(
            DialogBox.getUserDialog(input, userImage),
            DialogBox.getNekoDialog(neko.run(input), nekoImage)
    );
    userInput.clear();

    if (neko.hasExited()) ``{``
        closeWindowWithDelay(3.0);
    ``}``
``}``
```
It is a suggestion but highly depends on how your code structure works.

Thanks for the clarification about the glibc requirement — that makes sense.

I wanted to ask whether there are plans to support Ubuntu 22.04 users natively as well (e.g. via an AppImage or a build linked against an older glibc), since 22.04 is still an LTS and some students may be on it by default.

I’m currently able to run GitMastery via Docker as a workaround, but wanted to check if there’s an intended non-container option for 22.04 users.

I think the key question in deciding whether a class should be static or non-static is whether the class is expected to maintain state or represent an object that needs to be instantiated.

If a class represents a “thing” or object with identity or state, then it should be non-static.

If a class represents pure behaviour, where its methods operate solely on input parameters and do not depend on or modify state, then I would usually declare the class as static.

For example, the Parser class in our IP that only processes and translates user input into commands for your chatbot would be declared as static to me since the class and its methods can operate well purely on input parameters and do not require any existing state or object instantiation.

Acknowledging that we generally refrain from using wildcards, in the scenario where we are at the .java file containing the base app, and where we expect to use a lot of the packages, would it be okay to use import &lt;package>.*, especially if we are using all of the classes in that package?

I think it was meant to be `case x:` because the first statement is referring to the use of colon in this kind of Java statement:
`cond ? if_true : if_false;`

The rule about surrounding the colons by whitespace also applies in this kind of code:

```
for (type item : collection) ``{``
    ...
``}``

You should use static for classes that perform stateless tasks, and non-static for those that manage specific data or external resources. 

Writing static classes makes them easier to call, but non-static instances are easier to test, as they allow you to swap configurations (like file paths), and prevent 'global variable' bugs that pop up when shared a state is modified unexpectedly.

Personally, going the non-static approach is better for the Storage class. By using an instance, you can pass the file path into the constructor. For example, your main program can use ```data/tasks.txt```, while your unit tests can instantiate a separate Storage object pointing to ```data/test.txt``` to avoid wiping your user data during testing.

Hi everyone! I’ve just finished Level 10 for my chatbot,

My implementation follows the JavaFX tutorial (up to part 5) quite closely, but I’ve tweaked the CSS to give it a more personalised touch.

I installed Sourcetree. When I try to set up either a newly generated Personal Access Token for Github, it gets rejected. Here are my steps:

2) Tools | Options | Authentication

3) Click Add

4) Set Hosting Service to Github.

5) Set Authentication to Personal Access Token

6) Click Refresh Personal Access Token

7) A Windows Security dialog opens including the instruction "Enter your PAT as the password for https://github.com/"

8) Put my GitHub user name in the User Name textbox. (This username works for logging into GitHub.)

9) Paste the Personal Access Token into the Password textbox.

10) Click OK.

Observed: Login failed. Authentication failed for GitHub with username &lt;my user name> - please check your account settings.

Expected: This to work.

Tried looking for people facing the same problem online, and found this user who faced the same problem: https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Sourcetree-questions/Cannot-get-SourceTree-to-accept-a-Github-personal-access-token/qaq-p/2943383

They suggested deleting the Atlassian folders they found in Users/&lt;My user name>/AppData tree and then running SourceTree again and using the Personal Access Token to log in when prompted. 

I tried deleting the Atlassian folders I found in the same location, but was not prompted to log in, and faced the same problem when I tried to add my Personal Access Token again.

In my opinion, it is better to have an abstract Command class, which has subclasses that execute the command.

For example, the parser would return a DeleteCommand, which has an execute method that calls your tasklist.deleteTask method and saves the task. Execution of the command would be done in the chatbot class.

Here is an example :

Under File => Settings => Editor => Code Style => Java, you can find the Wrapping and Braces tab
Untick "Indent 'case' branches" under switch statement/expression
<img width="977" height="730" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b158cf3-5b3f-4b91-9256-d4e86b695212" />

I'm unsure if there's anything else you need to do, because for me that is all to make the Switch Case expressions line up

Do double check that the preview in the settings screen does line up with what the settings state.

Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that you're returning a switch case, in which the IDE will use that indentation.
I suggest separating the return and switch case into seperate lines.

See below for how this interaction occurs with the return statement

If association is to be expressed as "either an attribute or a line, but not both, where a line is preferred", then for the exams, if we are asked to "Draw a class diagram", showing "**the attributes**, methods, associations, navigabilities, and multiplicities" (similar to that stated in the second image), does this imply that we should now be expressing the association as an attribute, so that we can explicitly state the attributes of the class? 

On a hypothetical note, if the question also specifies "access modifiers" to be included in the class diagram, would this also force us to express association as an attribute rather than a line?

If compartments may be omitted, and the attributes/operations themselves can also be omitted if deemed irrelevant to the purpose of the diagram, then how will we represent a class with no attributes (and/or operations)? 

By the same token, when looking at a UML class diagram, is it correct to say that even if the class diagram has an empty attribute compartment, we cannot conclude that the class has no attributes, right?

I think having the lambda expression span multiple lines kind of defeats the purpose of using such a simple lambda expression.

The Separator wrap check seems to be assuming that the "(" is the left bracket in the outermost function call, rather than what it is (a lambda as a parameter). If it were me, I would suppress both warnings.

EDIT: after doing level-10 I see that I'm wrong, here's the JavaFX tutorial example code:
'''
userInput.setOnAction((event) -&gt; ``{``
            handleUserInput();
        ``}``);
''''

This implementation would pass checkstyle without suppression:
'''
@Test
    public void deserialiseTask_invalidTodo_exceptionThrown() ``{``
        assertThrows(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class, () -&gt; ``{``

You can essentially just "shift" the commit to the correct branch by:

git checkout correct-branch

Grab the commit: git cherry-pick &lt;commit-hash>

Go back to the wrong branch: git checkout wrong-branch

Remove it: git reset --hard HEAD~1 (This wipes the last commit on this branch)

In a way its "copying" the commit to the right branch and then "deleting" it from the wrong one, which should be easier than recreating the same commit.

If theres multiple commits above then you can still do the cherry picking, so it can be

Get the ID: Copy the hash of the commit u wanted (e.g. a1b2c3d).
Switch to correct branch: git checkout correct-branch
Cherry-pick it: git cherry-pick a1b2c3d

So now your correct branch has the right commit copied into it already, if you don't mind leaving the wrong commit in your old branch you technically don't need to do anything else. 

For this mod idk about the policy for removing wrong commits in a branch if they are already under multiple commits, but if you wanna try can look into git rebase or revert (to revert a past commit in a branch). Hopefully someone from the teaching team can comment which is recommended?

Hi @LouisC-Yu I tried to understand what went wrong and the important information is that you did a force push. (A fix to a smaller problem but it causes some major aftereffects you're experiencing now)

My guess is that your fork (`LouisC-Yu/ip`) lost the original commit history due to a force push from an **unrelated** repo. You probably created a locally initialised repo (_See comment below_) instead of cloning the fork. When you force pushed, that new history replaced the fork’s original history.

As the two repository has no common ancestor now, GitHub is confused as to how to "merge" (something like: at which point in the repo's histories should I start merging from?), so it can’t create a PR.

I am thinking you can fix it by reapplying your files (with the edits you have done on this `LouisC-Yu/ip`, unrelated repo) on top of upstream’s `master` so your repo becomes a **child** of the original history again.

Here's a set of possible solution:

 1. Save everything first (so that we won't accidentally force overwrite anything; Really impt in case my recommendation fails, you can still save this copy)
```
git add .
git commit -m "backup before fixing history"
git branch backup-broken
```

2. Add the real ip repo as upstream
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NUS-CS2103-AY2526-S2/ip.git
git fetch upstream
```

3. Create a new branch that starts from the real history
```
git checkout -b fixed-master upstream/master
```

Now this branch has correct ip commit history.

4. Bring Louis’s project files onto this branch
```
git checkout master -- .
```

(This copies his current files into this branch.)

5. Commit his work on top of upstream
```
git add .
git commit -m "Apply my project changes on top of upstream master"
```
Now history becomes:

ip commits → Louis commit (Imagine this a nodes of a graph, your commit now builds on the ip commits)

6. Push the fixed branch
```
git push origin fixed-master
```

7. Create PR

On GitHub:
```
base: NUS-CS2103-AY2526-S2/ip → master
compare: Louis repo → fixed-master
```
PR will now work because there is a common ancestor.

_Comment: You did either of the following.
(1) Zipped the repo and download, so you only have the files but not shared history. Something like having `x1 = [1], x2 = [1]` but `x1 is x2 == False` in python, simply 2 different objects;
(2) Ran `git init` instead of cloning the fork properly._ 

I used ChatGPT to help reason about the Git history issue and to get directions about the steps to take to allow a PR to be created. I read and adapted the explanation and commands before posting. Prompt (instructions quoted from @damithc 's instructions):
"Louis has an issue creating a PR from a forked repo to the upstream repo. Come up with a concrete set of steps/commands to go from the current 'broken' state to a state from which the PR can be created. Currently, the problem is there are no common commits between the upstream repo https://github.com/NUS-CS2103-AY2526-S2/ip.git and the local repo. Recommend for me the sequence of commands Louis should run"

Feel free to comment, thanks!

Hmmm, I was wrong, this will create brand new commits which do not preserve the tags. From what I see there are two options: (1) move the tags over to the new commits, or (2) recreate the tags manually. This may lose record of the actual commit timestamp though.

IMO, it does not really violate the coding standard, since it does "sound like" a boolean. However, I do believe that this form of programming can be flawed in certain scenarios, i.e. if the save transaction is critical, like a backup, where it may be important to alert the user/program that saving has failed, and thus it may be wise to throw an exception to alert them. Contrast that with the function being non-critical, like saving to cache, then I think allowing it to return a true/false would be perfectly acceptable.

My understanding is as follow: 

In your setup, git revert HEAD  and git reset [--flag] HEAD~1 can achieve the same thing, which is to delete/undo the extra line "hi" you have committed locally, but not pushed to repo. 

However, if you use git revert, your local repo will be **2 commits ahead** of your remote. If you use git reset, your local repo will be the **same commit** as your remote (not ahead/behind)

In the beginning, you commit empty.txt locally and also push it to remote. Then, you commit an added line "hi" locally, but didn't push it to remote. At this point, your local repo is one commit ahead of the remote repo. Then, to delete/undo your "hi" line, you do either of the following:

- use git revert HEAD. As mentioned in your point 1., you basically make a new commit to erase the "hi" line added, and you didn't push this revert commit to remote. This create one more commit, and your local repo is now 2 commits ahead of your remote repo.

- use git reset [--flag] HEAD~1. You delete (actually is de-referenced) the current commit pointed under the HEAD, which is the added "hi" line. The HEAD move back to the previous commit (HEAD~1). So you local repo is now the same commit as your remote repo (not ahead/behind).

I agree with your point 1-4

Please feel free to correct me if I made any errors in understanding. Thank you.

IMO even though trySaveTransaction() does not really violate the rule even though it doesn’t use is or has, the word "try" seems to imply a boolean result (success or failure), so it is still readable. However, personally, I would probably use something like "isTransactionSaved()" or similar variants to make it much more readable for the others since this would make it similar to the Java coding standard.

I usually default to non-static classes unless there’s a strong reason not to. Even if static works, keeping things as objects feels cleaner to me because it’s easier to extend later and easier to reason about who owns what.

For iP specifically, I’m okay making Parser static since it can be pretty stateless, but I prefer Ui and Storage as non-static because they naturally carry stuff like input/output behaviour or file path/config. It’s just less painful if I need to change or test things later.

Rule of thumb for me: `static` for anything stateless or global.

Longer answer, static classes either hold pure functions (like formatting/parsing, encoding/decoding, etc. since Java doesn't support standalone functions) or singletons - classes with a single global instance. So it all boils down to your design considerations: Do you only need one instance of the class you're creating?

For me, I almost never use static classes unless it's pure utility, since you could sometimes need multiple instances of UI, Storage, etc. for testing and what not.

Static method is simpler. I use static methods whenever they don't interact with the object states.

Hello, I faced the exact error twice after merging with `add-gradle-support` branch. From researching online, many would suggest running `Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace`. However, this did not work for me.

I suspect my error had something to do with VS Code utilising extension cache files for the following extension: *Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat*

To fix the error (worked for me both times), I resorted to uninstalling and reinstalling VS Code.
Do delete the following directories too before installing VS Code again:
1. %APPDATA%\Code
2. %USERPROFILE%\.vscode

Hope this helps!

Personally, I usually start with a non-static class if im not sure as I feel that it helps keep the design "open" while the requirements are still unclear. As the project iterates, if there is no meaningful behaviour, I feel that refactoring it into having static methods is easier than if I were to do the opposite.

> There is no default multiplicity in UML. If a class diagram does not show the multiplicity of an association, it simply means the multiplicity is unspecified.

Yup, I think that there can be any number of Person's that must have an Address (including 0, although saying it sounds weird), so 1 and only 1 is false. 
Personally I think the question is also trying to confuse us with "1" and the association navigation (seeing if we confused it with something like "A Person can only have one Address object as its home address" and then clicking True).

Hi, I don’t think you are required to rectify the commits for Level 9, as the ```Git Standard``` requirement only tracks your latest five iP commits and is not tied to any specific week. Therefore, you just need to ensure that your commit messages from Week 4 onwards comply with the standard so that it becomes and remains green.

Yes you can! For me, I added a method to Duke.java to return the exit status of a command. Then I edited the `handleUserInput` method to check if the command indicates an exit. I also added a pause transition so the farewell message shows as follows:
```
Stage stage = (Stage) dialogContainer.getScene().getWindow();
PauseTransition pause = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(1));
pause.setOnFinished(e -&gt; ``{``
     stage.close();
``}``);
pause.play();
```

**1. :fas-info-circle: [iP] Will there be potential issues if most functions are static?**
</div>

In the iP, most of my methods are declared as static. Could this cause any issues down the road if this were a longer term project? Curious as the code snippets provided for `A-MoreOOP` seemed to have implemented them as non-static methods, as evident in `ui = new Ui();`.

Here are some of my examples:
```
public class Storage ``{``
    public final static String STORAGE_FILE_PATH = "tasks.txt";
    public static void storeTasks(TaskList taskList) ``{``
        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(STORAGE_FILE_PATH);
            ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos)) ``{``
            
            oos.writeObject(taskList);
            // System.out.println("Object successfully saved to " + STORAGE_FILE_PATH);

        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
            System.err.println("Error saving object: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        ``}``
    ``}``
    // Other methods redacted
``}``
```

```
public class Ui ``{``
    protected static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void printWelcomeMessage() ``{``
        System.out.println("----------------------------");
        System.out.println("What can I help you with?");
        System.out.println("----------------------------");
    ``}``

    public static String promptInput() ``{``
        System.out.print("Input > ");
        String command = sc.nextLine();
        return command;
    ``}``
``}``
```

So most of them will be called as `Ui.promptInput();` or `Storage.storeTasks(taskList);`.

I used version 11.0.0 since I remember seeing somewhere that was the original version that the files were designed for. In my case I'm using the "Checkstyle for Java" VSCode plugin since that's the IDE I'm using, though. So probably not that helpful to you.

11.0.1 and 11.1.0 should still work, I think.

Hi, yes, you can close the GUI window programmatically when the user types "bye".

In your `chatbot.java` (equivalent chatbot class), add `Platform.exit()` to your bye method:
'''java
public String bye() ``{``
    this.storage.linesToFile(cqlist.getList());
    String message = "Bye. Hope to see you again soon!";
    Platform.exit();
    return ui.constructMessage(message);
``}``
'''

Make sure to import:
'''java
import javafx.application.Platform;
'''

`Platform.exit()` properly shuts down the JavaFX application and closes all windows.

Hey, heres my analogy of whats going on if it helps 

git revert
git revert undoes a commit by creating a new commit that reverses the changes introduced by the original one. The original commit remains in the history, but its effects are cancelled out by the new revert commit. This means the working directory reflects the undone changes, while the commit history remains intact. Because no history is rewritten, revert is safe to use on commits that have already been pushed to a shared remote repository.
Analogy:
Think of it like publishing an errata for a lecture/teaching session you had. You cannot just scrap the whole slides because of a small error because it would be wasteful and people depend on the slides so you add in an errata to let everyone know.

git reset --soft
A soft reset moves the HEAD pointer back to the specified commit but leaves both the staging area and the working directory unchanged. The changes from the undone commit remain staged and ready to be committed again. This is useful when you want to modify or squash recent commits without losing any work or changing file contents.
Analogy:
This is like deciding not to officially release a set of slides yet, but keeping all your edits neatly prepared and ready to publish again. Nothing is lost; you are just rewinding the record of what was officially released.

git reset --mixed (default)
A mixed reset moves the HEAD pointer back and also resets the staging area to match the target commit, but it leaves the working directory unchanged. The changes from the undone commit remain in the files but are unstaged. This is commonly used when you want to redo how changes are staged or split a commit into smaller pieces.
Analogy:
I would say its more like you publish a set of slides but theres quite a decent chunk of erratas that makes it easier to just unpublish the slides and change it and haven’t slated it for republishing yet? Sorry if this doesn’t make a lot of sense haha. But yeah its too big a task for a separate errata slides and would make the readers life annoying if they had to keep swapping between the two

git reset --hard
A hard reset moves the HEAD pointer back and resets both the staging area and the working directory to exactly match the target commit. All changes made after that commit are permanently discarded from both staging and files. This operation is destructive and should be used with caution, especially if the changes are not recoverable.
Analogy:
This is like deleting all edits you made after a certain lecture and restoring the slides exactly to how they were at before that point. Perhaps because you made the slides in a hurry and theres too many errors to be able to fix it reasonably and its just easier to start from scratch

You can also avoid having to manually key in your credentials every time by using SSH keys. 
[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

Once you have your system's SSH key set up on github you can clone using the repo's SSH address instead of the HTTPS address and you won't have to keep signing in.

I also encountered similar issues as a Windows + VS Code user. 
Gradle gave me this error:
> Unsupported class file major version 65

This caused VS Code not being able to recognise this as a Java project and everything just failed from there. 

I found out this is because Gradle is is using the Java Runtime Environment provided by _Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat_
Their documentation says this:
> Now that Java extension will publish platform specific versions, it will embed a JRE for supported platforms such as win32-x64, win32-arm64, linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-x64, darwin-arm64. The embedded JRE is used to launch the Language Server for Java. Users are only responsible for configuring [Project JDKs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java#project-jdks) to compile your Java projects.

To fix, open VS Code user settings (JSON) and add in the following:
```
"java.import.gradle.java.home": "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\JDK"
```
Updating Gradle to a newer version also fixes the issue, though I am not too sure if this is allowed. @damithc

I think this is a gradle and jdk version compatibility issue. You can try either downgrade your Java version to Java 17 (update your environment path) or upgrade your gradle to version 9.1.0 or above. I would recommend downgrade your Java version more since most course materials run on Java 17

As stated earlier, I agree that it is better to abstract out the commands too. I highly recommend doing it too as I have found it significantly easier to edit and maintain my code for future checkpoints (especially the GUI portion). As you already have the correct implementation, it shouldn't take too long to abstract out these features too.

My theory is that after you created your fork, you downloaded the files via zip instead of cloning the repo.

This would explain why the history is completely divergent and why you had to force push.

To fix this:
1. backup your changes to another local branch
```
git branch -m changes
```

2. add the root ip repo as upstream
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NUS-CS2103-AY2526-S2/ip.git
```

3. pull the master branch from upstream
```
git checkout -b master upstream/master
git pull
```

4. rebase changes into master
```
git switch changes
git rebase master
```

This will create merge conflicts in 3 files that you would have to resolve.

After this your fork should have matching history with the upstream repo and you may want to rename your branch back to master.
